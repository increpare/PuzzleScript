<h1>PuzzleScript Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
<h2>If you're playing PuzzleScript games hosted on puzzlescript.net</h2>
<p>
	Puzzlescript games accesed at urls like "<i>puzzlescript.net/play.html?...</i>"" are stored on github  as <a href="https://gist.github.com">gists</a> and fetched from there with their <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">Developer API</a>.  Their privacy policy is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">here</a>.
<p>
	Why do I need to store things there? I need to store games somewhere - I think the sharing functionality is really importat for puzzlescript, and makes making + sharing games really easy. 
<p>
	If you don't want to use the online-sharing facilities you can still save/load game locally, and can still export standalone html files.
<p>
	The puzzlescript player uses google analytics - I use this to track what games people have been playing, so as to be able to more easily keep track of what people are making with the tool.  
<p>
<h2>If you're creating PuzzleScript games</h2> 
<ul>
	<li>Puzzlescript can save things to your browser's localstorage - it's just used for loading/saving files in the file save dropdown.
	<li>If you share a game, you need to authorize with your <a href="http://github.com">github account</a>.  Then, when you hit share in future, a publicly-accessible copy of your game is uploaded to a <a href="http://github.com">gist</a> in your account.  
</ul>
