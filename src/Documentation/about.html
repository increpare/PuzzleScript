<h1>About</h1>
<p>
PuzzleScript was developed by me (with the assistance/feedback of <a href="credits.html">many other people + tools</a>), <a href="http://www.increpare.com">increpare</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/increpare">@increpare</a>). Programming puzzle games isn't all that hard in the grand scheme of things, but the barrier to entry is way higher than it needs to be.  
<p>
It's not a general purpose game making tool, it's not even a general purpose puzzle game making tool.  Or even a avatar-based turn-based puzzle game making tool - games like <a href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewsitepage.php?id=90294">DROD</a> don't work, or games with very nuanced behaviours, like <a href="http://www.increpare.com/2012/06/puzzles/">Puzzles</a> proved impossible.  But it is a tool, and I think it might prove handy/enabling for a number of people, if one is accepting of its limitations.
<p>
I've worked on a lot of puzzle games, and decided on a particular group of those that could be handily modelled with a scripting language.  I've seen someone do a similar pattern-matching system before (I can't remember who, though), but it was a lot less flexible - the movement system in this engine is what gives it its real power.
<p>
Getting the engine out the door, so to speek, took several weeks of full-time, unreumerated work, and no doubt there's plenty more to come. I am not a wealthy man, I'm an impoverished, self-employed independent game developer whose involvement with such projects amounts to happy indiscretions.  If you appreciate this piece of software, please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/increpare">supporting me on patreon</a> :)
<p>
I've you've made something cool with the engine, please let me know ( <a href="mailto:analytic@gmail.com">analytic@gmail.com</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/increpare">@increpare</a> ) - I'd love to highlight (and maybe even host as examples) wonderful things that people've made with this.
