It appears the initial code snippet includes sections that are not recognized by the PuzzleScript compiler, specifically lines such as the "objective" description and website link which are not valid within this language. I will correct the code by removing these sections and sticking to the core PuzzleScript structure.

Here's a repaired version of the code:

```

This version should compile without errors. The "objective" and "homepage" sections as well as any unnecessary text within the prelude have been removed.
