The errors in your code stem from the use of invalid sections in the PuzzleScript specification. PuzzleScript doesn't require a separator for the author section and handles a few specific sections such as title, objects, legend, collisionlayers, rules, winconditions, and levels. The rule for the sounds section is optional but allowed in later versions. The palette section isn't typically used in PuzzleScript. Let's adjust the code to fit correct format:

```plaintext
===========
title Simple Sokoban
===========

author GameDesigner

===========
objects
===========
Background 000000
Player 00FF00
Wall FF0000
Box 0000FF
Target FFFF00

===========
legend
===========
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target

===========
collisionlayers
===========
Background
Player, Box
Wall
Target

===========
rules
===========
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]

===========
winconditions
===========
All Box on Target

===========
levels
===========
#####
#...#
#.T.#
#PB.#

```

The code provided corrects the errors by removing unnecessary sections and ensuring consistency with the PuzzleScript game description language. Note that the `palette` section was removed as PuzzleScript doesn't typically recognize it separatelyâ€”color is defined within the `objects` section itself.
