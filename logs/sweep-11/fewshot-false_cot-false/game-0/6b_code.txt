### Explanation:

1. **Object Definitions**: In the `objects` section, each object should be listed exactly once. The original code had duplicate entries. I removed the repeated entries for better clarity.

2. **Collision Layers**: Adjusted the `collisionlayers` section to be consistent with typical ordering. It generally helps avoid potential issues with overlapping or interaction of objects in mind when deciding this.

These changes resolve the issues reported in the console output, focusing on proper object definition and order.
