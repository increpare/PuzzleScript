Certainly! The console output indicates formatting issues with your rules and win conditions. Let's address these errors step-by-step:

1. The rules must have matching patterns on both sides. Ensure each part of a rule has an equivalent number of cells.

2. The win condition format seems incorrect. The correct format should be a logical win condition statement.

Here is the repaired version of your game code:

Changes made:

- Ensured correct rule syntax: Each cell reference on the left side of a rule has a corresponding reference on the right side.
- Modified the win condition to the correct format: `All BoxOnTarget` verifies that all boxes are on the targets for winning.

This should address the errors and allow the game to compile and work as intended. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
