The console errors suggest issues with formatting in the rules and win conditions. I'll adjust the PuzzleScript code to reflect proper rule structure and win condition statements. Below is the corrected version of the game code:

### Key Fixes:
1. **Rule Alignment**: Ensured each pattern on the left has a matching pattern on the right with equal length or blank where applicable.
2. **Win Condition Structure**: Corrected the win condition to follow the proper format using "on" to ensure all `BoxOnTarget` are over `Target`.

This should fix the errors previously reported in the console output. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
