The errors in the console output indicate that there is a problem with the sprite definition for the "Player" and "Wall" objects. In PuzzleScript, the sprite matrices should only contain characters that correspond to designated colors, not arbitrary characters like "o". Let’s fix the sprite matrices for these objects and return the corrected version of the code.

In this corrected version, I've replaced the arbitrary "o" characters with "0" in the sprite definitions for consistency. The "0" represents the colored part of the sprite according to the color indicated for each object.
