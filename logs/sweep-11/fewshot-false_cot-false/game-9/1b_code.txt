The errors you're encountering are likely due to some formatting issues in the sprite definitions and possibly the prelude of your PuzzleScript game code. Let's address these and provide you with a repaired version of the code:

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Commenting Error**: Changed `Comment:` to `#Comment:` as PuzzleScript uses the hashtag symbol for comments.
   
2. **Sprite Definitions**: Updated the `Player` and `PlayerOnTarget` sprite matrices for consistency and to ensure none of the dots/characters are outside the matrix bounds. Initially, your `Player` sprite matrix may have exceeded allowable bounds or been improperly formatted, causing those specific errors.

This should correct the issues you encountered with the sprite matrix definitions and prelude comments. Try recompiling the game with these changes.
