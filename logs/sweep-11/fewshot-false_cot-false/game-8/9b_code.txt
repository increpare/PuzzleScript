Certainly! Here is a repaired version of the game code. I've resolved issues related to missing keys and incorrect handling of spaces:

### Changes and Fixes:
1. Removed accidental extra lines that were causing errors.
2. Ensured the usage of characters in the `LEVELS` section matches the characters defined in the `LEGEND`.

The errors you encountered were likely due to unintentional extra or incorrect entries, which I have removed in the fixed version.
