The errors in your code appear to be caused by incorrect sound token definitions and some issues with the levels provided. Let's fix those issues.

1. The sound tokens (SFX1, SFX2, SFX3) in PuzzleScript are typically linked directly to in-game events in the engine itself; they should not be custom-named within the script.
2. The errors regarding " " and specific keys not found in the map suggest a potential mismatch between the game's legend and its level representation, likely due to a mistake in parsing level symbols.
3. Empty space in levels should be represented by the Background object, which is typically "."

Key changes:
- Removed the "SOUNDS" section as custom sound assignments aren't directly defined in PuzzleScript like this. Actual sound triggering based on events uses predefined sounds in the engine.
- Verified that level layouts use appropriate legend symbols as defined in the LEGEND section: ".", "P", "K", "D", "G", "W". Adjusted level symbols to ensure correct parsing.
