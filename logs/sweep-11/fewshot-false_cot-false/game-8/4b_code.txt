Certainly! Here is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. I've fixed the errors related to the sound declaration and ensured symbols in the `LEVELS` section are defined correctly.

Changes made:
- Fixed the `SOUNDS` section to declare the sounds correctly using identifiers `SFX1`, `SFX2`, and `SFX3`.
- Updated `RULES` section to use the correct sound identifiers for sound effects.
- Ensured the `.`, `P`, `K`, `D`, `G`, `W` symbols are consistent in both the `LEGEND` and `LEVELS` section, and no unnecessary letters/symbols are used in the `LEVELS`.

The game should now compile without the previous errors.
