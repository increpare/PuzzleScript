Certainly! Let's address each of the errors mentioned:

1. The `SOUNDS` section should contain only the sound names and their corresponding sound codes. In this example, we should define simple sound identifiers without any verbose description.

2. The `RULES` section must follow a `COLLISIONLAYERS` section, even if that section is empty.

3. Key `"E"` is not found in the `LEGEND`. Each letter or symbol used must be defined.

I'll correct these points in the code below:

Here’s a summary of the corrections:
- Each sound specification is now a simplified placeholder (such as `#soundcode 1`) for where sound effect codes would be placed.
- Properly included the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section before `RULES`.
- Corrected the `LEGEND` to remove any undefined symbols.
  
Make sure to replace the `#soundcode` placeholders with actual sound codes if available in your game's context.
