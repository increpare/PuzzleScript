Certainly! To resolve these errors, we need to ensure:

1. The "SOUNDS" section must be present even if it's empty because the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section must follow the "SOUNDS".
2. Object names referred to in rules should be in the correct case, matching the definitions in the "OBJECTS" section.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

This updated code includes the "SOUNDS" section before "COLLISIONLAYERS," even if it is empty, and it ensures that all names used in the rules match the object names precisely in terms of case.
