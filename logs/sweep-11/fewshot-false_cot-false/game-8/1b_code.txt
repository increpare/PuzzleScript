Certainly! The errors in the original code are due to the incorrect definition of objects and some typographical errors in various sections. Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

**Key Fixes Made:**
1. Corrected the `OBJECTS` section title from `OBJEC` to `OBJECTS`.
2. Fixed `SOUNDS` section title which was incorrectly spelled as `SOUND`.
3. Modified rules to properly handle player and key interactions: 
   - Corrected the rule syntax to ensure keys are picked up correctly and the door is opened with the key.
4. Corrected `WINCONDITIONS` to ensure proper game behaviour: `All Goal` to ensure all goal conditions are met to win.

These fixes should solve the console output errors and get the game running properly.
