The errors in your PuzzleScript code are due to several syntax issues. Here's a corrected version of the game code:

### Key Fixes:

1. **Collision Layers**: 
   - You listed `Player, Key, Door, Goal, Wall` on a single line in `COLLISIONLAYERS`. They need to be on separate lines.

2. **Rules**:
   - The `RULES` section needs matching patterns on the right for each pattern on the left.
   - Make sure the patterns specified in the rule brackets `[ ... ]` are consistent.
   - Ensure sound commands like `SFX3` are placed correctly at the end of rule lines where you want the sound to play.
   - Fixed the rule for interacting with the door directly; you likely wanted `[ > Player | Door ] -> [ Player | Background ]`.

3. **Win Conditions**:
   - Made sure the sound for winning is linked properly using `SFX3` at the right place.

4. **Levels Layout**:
   - The game symbols (like spaces in this case) should be in the LEGEND. Spaces should represent a valid object, which I've addressed by ensuring the level maps use only defined symbols. Each level layout should strictly follow the defined LEGEND.

This should fix the syntax errors and ensure that your game runs correctly.
