The console errors indicate issues with the sound effects implementation and the map symbols. PuzzleScript does not support sound as described in your script. Additionally, it seems you've used single spaces in the map, which are not defined in the "LEGEND". Let's correct these issues. Also, remove the 'SOUNDS' section since PuzzleScript does not support custom sounds. Here is the corrected version:

Note that I've removed the sound-related parts because PuzzleScript does not support custom sound identifiers or files directly like you've used `treasuresound` and `sound treasuresound`. Sound can often be part of configuring a game setup, but PuzzleScript as a language focuses on simpler game creation logic without custom sound files.
