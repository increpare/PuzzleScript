Certainly! The errors encountered stem from a few issues which need fixing:

1. Each sprite must be 5x5 instead of 4x4.
2. The walls should be added to the LEGEND section.
3. There is no need for a specific collision layer for Background since it's typically used as the default.
4. The `WINCONDITIONS` should be adjusted because it's not possible to have a "Target on Player" if both will occupy the same space.

Below is the corrected version of the code:

```

In the `WINCONDITIONS`, since the player is supposed to reach and overlap with the target for victory, you use `No Target`, which means that all targets have been reached by the player. Additionally, make sure to include walls in the `LEGEND` as `W = Wall`. Additionally, the sprites have been corrected to have a size of 5x5.
