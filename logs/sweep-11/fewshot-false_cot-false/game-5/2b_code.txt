Certainly! The issues in your PuzzleScript code are related to the format of the win condition and level definition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of your game code:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Win Condition**: The win condition format was incorrect. Updated to `All Player on Goal`, which is the correct structure for win conditions in PuzzleScript. Use "All", "Some", or "No" to define the win condition.

2. **Levels**: The levels were incorrectly described due to an improper use of comments. Ensure no extra unintended characters interrupt your level layouts. I've matched them similarly to your provided examples.

With these corrections, your game should now compile without errors.
