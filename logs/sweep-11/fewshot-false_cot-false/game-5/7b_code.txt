The issue with both levels is that the player cannot reach the goal due to obstacles or incorrect placement. To make the levels solvable, the player needs a clear path to reach the goal without being blocked by walls. Below is the modified game code with corrected levels:

In the first level, I've added a path for the player to reach the goal. In the second level, I adjusted the positions to ensure that the player can navigate around the walls and reach the goal.
