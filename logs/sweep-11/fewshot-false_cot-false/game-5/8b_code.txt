The issue with the provided levels is that there is no way for the player to move onto the goal due to the walls blocking the path or surrounding the goal. To make the levels solvable, they need to be restructured so that the player has a clear path to reach the goal. Here is a corrected version of the game code:

In this updated version, the player can navigate to the goal without being blocked by walls. Each level has been designed to be solvable.
