Certainly! The code you provided contains a few errors related to the sounds section and the win condition format. Let's correct them:

1. **Sound Section**: PuzzleScript expects specific sound event definitions if you're going to have a sounds section. Since there are no sounds defined, you can simply remove this section if it's not being used.

2. **Win Condition**: PuzzleScript uses specific conditions for winning. Instead of `[ no Box ][ no Target ]`, it should be a condition that matches when all boxes are on targets, such as transforming all `Box` into `BoxOnTarget`.

Here's the revised code:

These changes should fix the errors and allow the game to compile correctly. If you wish to implement sounds, you can define specific sounds under the `SOUNDS` section, following the possible sound events in PuzzleScript (e.g., SFX0, SFX1, etc.).
