To fix the errors reported in the console output, we need to adhere to the PuzzleScript syntax conventions. Below is the corrected version of your code:

```plaintext
# Legend
player = Player
goal = Goal
wall = Wall
floor = Floor
playerOnGoal = PlayerOnGoal

=== COLLISIONLAYERS ===
Background,
wall,
player, goal

=== RULES ===
# Player movement doesn't need explicit rules unless combined with other actions

# Goal check
[ player | goal ] -> [ playerOnGoal ]
[ playerOnGoal ] -> [ playerOnGoal ]

=== WINCONDITIONS ===
All playerOnGoal

=== LEVELS ===
# Level 1
...goal...
..wallwallwall..
..wallplayer...
..wallwallwall..
...floor...

# Level 2
.....goal.
..wall...
..wall.player.
..wall...
...goal...
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Legend Definitions:** Make sure the object definitions match variable names and logical naming, such as `player` for `Player`, `goal` for `Goal`, etc. This aligns with how PuzzleScript expects objects to be defined.

2. **Collision Layers:** Use the same casing and naming as defined in the Legend section. Ensure lowercase use where appropriate, as `PuzzleScript` case sensitivity can be crucial.

3. **Rules for Object Transitions:** The rules were restructured from old syntax, ensuring that conditions accurately depict how objects transform. Use proper positional shorthand like `[ player | goal ] -> [ playerOnGoal ]`.

4. **Level Mapping:** Replace shorthand characters with full names as defined in the Legend section to ensure consistency and clarity.
