Certainly! The provided game code has a few errors related to section ordering and inconsistent casing in object names. Let's correct those issues:

1. The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should follow the `SOUNDS` section. Even if you don't use sounds, you need to include an empty `SOUNDS` section for the order to be correct.
2. Object names in rules should match exactly as they were defined in the `OBJECTS` section, including their casing.

Here's the corrected version of your code:
