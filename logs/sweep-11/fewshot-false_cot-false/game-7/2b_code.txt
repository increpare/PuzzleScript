The issue in your code is related to the incorrect usage of the "SOUNDS" section. PuzzleScript does not support a "SOUNDS" category in the way you have written it, so you'll need to remove that section entirely. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```plaintext

```

Essentially, I've removed the SOUNDS section, as it's not valid in the PuzzleScript language. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
