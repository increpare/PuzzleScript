The errors in your PuzzleScript code seem to be related to a misunderstanding of the color and sounds syntax. Here's a corrected version of your game code:

Key Changes Made:

1. Changed `PlayerOnTarget` color from `lightyellow` to `yellow`, which was already defined in your `Player` object. In PuzzleScript, you can't use colors that are not predefined, hence the change.
2. Removed the `SOUNDS` section, as the sounds functionality is not available directly in PuzzleScript. They might be part of some additional functionality in a custom version or extension of PuzzleScript, but they are not part of the base PuzzleScript language.

If you're using a customized version of PuzzleScript that supports sounds, you might need to configure them according to that system's specific syntax or implementation.
