The following PuzzleScript game code contains some issues related to the order and structure of the sections. Let's correct this to ensure it complies with the expected format. The issues primarily involve misplaced Legend and Objective sections, and incorrect win condition syntax.

```plaintext
# Legend
a = Player
b = Goal
c = Wall
d = Floor

# Objectives
z = PlayerOnGoal

=== CollisionLayers ===
Background
PlayerLayer = a
GoalLayer   = b
WallLayer   = c

=== Rules ===
# Player movement
[right] a -> a [right]
[left]  a -> a [left]
[up]    a -> a [up]
[down]  a -> a [down]

# Goals checking
a on b -> z

=== WinConditions ===
All z

=== Levels ===
# Level 1
...b...
..ccc..
..ca...
..ccc..
...d...

# Level 2
.....b.
..c...
..c.a.
..c...
...b...
```

### Corrections Made:
1. **Legend Section**: Fixed syntax by placing `=` to correctly bind objects with their names, e.g., `a = Player`.
2. **Objective Representation**: Introduced a new representation `z` for the player on goal.
3. **Win Conditions Correction**: Updated to use the matched `z` object.
4. **Collision Layers**: Ensured layers were correctly declared and named.
5. **Goal Rule Correction**: The `a on b -> z` rule correctly combines `a` when on a `b` to transform into `z`, rather than using an undefined object or action.

This should resolve the errors you're encountering and ensure that the code runs smoothly.
