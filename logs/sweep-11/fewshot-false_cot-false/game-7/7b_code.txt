The errors seem to indicate issues in the "LEGEND" section. The PuzzleScript "LEGEND" section is used to define sprites and aliases, and each line should make a simple assignment of sprites to names using little to no spacing and lowercase letters. Additionally, it looks like the placement of the background layer is not necessary here. Below is a corrected version of the code that should address these errors:

```plaintext
=== OBJECTS ===
Background
wall
player
goal
floor
playerOnGoal

=== LEGEND ===
. = Background
# = wall
P = player
G = goal
F = floor
@ = playerOnGoal

=== COLLISIONLAYERS ===
wall,
player, goal

=== RULES ===
# Automatically transform player on goal
[ player | goal ] -> [ playerOnGoal ]

=== WINCONDITIONS ===
All playerOnGoal

=== LEVELS ===
# Level 1
...G...
..###..
..#P#..
..###..
...F...

# Level 2
.....G.
..#...
..#.P.
..#...
...G...

```

Here are the changes made:
- Updated `LEGEND` to use character representations for easier typing and drawing the levels.
- Defined all necessary elements in the `OBJECTS` section.
- Standardized the presentation of levels using the characters defined in the `LEGEND`.
- Removed the background layer from `COLLISIONLAYERS` as it isn't usually necessary and set abstractly.
- Ensured objects are explicitly defined before being used in the levels for clarity. 

This should eliminate the errors related to the misled map objects, though most errors needed refocusing due to misunderstanding object relationships.
