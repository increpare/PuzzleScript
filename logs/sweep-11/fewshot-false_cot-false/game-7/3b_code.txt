The errors in the original code come from the incorrect structure, placement of sections, and possibly unsupported features or syntax issues. Let me revise the code so that it adheres to the correct PuzzleScript syntax and structure:

```plaintext
# Legend
a = Player
b = Goal
c = Wall
d = Floor
z = PlayerOnGoal

=== CollisionLayers ===
Background
Wall
Player, Goal

=== Rules ===
# Player movement doesn't need explicit rules unless combined with other actions
[right]  a -> a
[left]   a -> a
[up]     a -> a
[down]   a -> a

# Goals checking
[b] [a] -> [z]
[z] -> [z]

=== WinConditions ===
All z

=== Levels ===
# Level 1
...b...
..ccc..
..ca...
..ccc..
...d...

# Level 2
.....b.
..c...
..c.a.
..c...
...b...
```

Key changes made:

1. Reformatted the Legend and CollisionLayers to ensure valid structure.
2. Combined `Player` and `Goal` into a single collision layer line, separated by a comma, so they can interact correctly.
3. Adjusted the rule syntax to correctly reflect player interaction with goals (`[b] [a]` -> `[z]`).
4. Removed unnecessary repeated rules (`z -> z` rule added for maintaining the state once goal is achieved).
5. Deleted unnecessary comments and fixed section structures (`#` comments should be within logical sections).

These changes should help resolve the initial errors and ensure the game functions correctly as per PuzzleScript conventions.
