The errors you've encountered are due to the sections being out of order and case sensitivity issues in referencing object names within the rules. Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code with the required sections in order and case sensitivity issues fixed:

In this version, I've made sure that all object names are consistently capitalized across the code to match their definitions in the OBJECTS section. Additionally, I've added an empty SOUNDS section to follow the required order for PuzzleScript documentation. The RULES section has also been adjusted to ensure it correctly references the object names with the correct case.
