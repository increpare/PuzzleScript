The console output indicates that there are errors related to the formatting of the objects section. Each object should have three fields: the object's name, a color, and a sprite grid representation. The color should be defined by a color name or an RGB value. Here is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript code:

In this corrected version:
- Each object now has a 5x5 sprite grid representing its appearance.
- I've provided a simple representation for each object using `0` for transparent and `1` for the colored pixels. Feel free to adjust the sprite representation as needed for your game.
