The errors in your PuzzleScript code relate to issues with section order, missing uppercase symbols in rules, and the improper use of identifiers. Here's the corrected code:

Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.
```

Here are the changes made:
1. Added an empty `SOUNDS` section as required by PuzzleScript.
2. Fixed the case sensitivity in the `RULES` section, changing `p`, `b`, and `g` to `Player`, `Box`, and `Goal` respectively to match object names defined in the `LEGEND`.
3. Adjusted line placements accordingly to comply with the section order expected by PuzzleScript.
