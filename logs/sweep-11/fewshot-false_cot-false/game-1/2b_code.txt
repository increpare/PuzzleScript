Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. The errors have been fixed by ensuring all sections are present and in the correct order, and by adjusting the case sensitivity of the object names in the rules.

Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.

### Changes Made:
1. **Added the `SOUNDS` section:** This section is now included, even if it remains empty, to satisfy the ordering requirement before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
2. **Corrected Case Sensitivity:** In the `RULES` section, I capitalized the object names to match the `LEGEND` definitions (`Player`, `Box`, `Goal`).
3. **Modified Rule Execution:** Included push direction (`>`) in the rules for correct box pushing mechanics.
