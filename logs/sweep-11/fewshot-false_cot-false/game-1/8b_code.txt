Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.

### Key Changes:

1. Removed the `SOUNDS` section since it was empty and causing an error.
2. Adjusted underlines in `COLLISIONLAYERS` to be consistent with others, making it `==================`.
3. Corrected level row lengths to be consistent and rectangular.
4. Added spaces to begin the section for `MESSAGES`.
