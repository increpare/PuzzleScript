The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect sprite definitions in your OBJECTS section. Each sprite should be visually designed with a 3x3 grid using numbers to refer to colors from a palette. In your case, you need to ensure that the colors you're referring to are defined correctly. Let me adjust your code to fix these issues.

In the corrected OBJECTS section, each sprite representation is fixed to make sure each pixel within those objects uses the colors defined in the object header:
- For `Player`, `Block`, `Target`, and `TargetBlock`, we ensured the colors match the headers given.

Ensure you test this out to confirm the fix resolves all mentioned errors.
