The errors you're encountering are due to the incorrect sprite definitions in the OBJECTS section. PuzzleScript requires the sprite matrix for each object to be strictly a 5x5 grid of characters where each `.` represents a pixel that should not be colored, and each `#` or other characters represent pixels that are colored.

Let's fix the sprite definitions while maintaining a 5x5 grid by replacing stray characters in each sprite with dots:

I have corrected the sprite definitions for `Player`, `Block`, and `Target`, ensuring the matrices meet the 5x5 requirement and contain only valid characters. This should fix the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
