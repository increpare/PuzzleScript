Here's a revised version of your PuzzleScript code. I've corrected the errors mentioned in your console output:

Changes made:
- Fixed issues with the player sprite matrix: It was missing a line for the 5x5 requirement.
- Corrected the target sprite so it's also a 5x5 matrix.
- Removed the empty `SOUNDS` section, which wasn't necessary.
- Added spaces in rules for consistent formatting.
- Fixed missing periods in the object sprites to meet the 5x5 dimension requirement.
