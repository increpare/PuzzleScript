line 17 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER.
line 29 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 55 : Was expecting a sound event (like SFX3, or ENDLEVEL) or an object name, but didn't find either.
