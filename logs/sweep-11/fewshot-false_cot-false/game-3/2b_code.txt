The errors you're seeing are due to incorrect sprite definitions. The numbers you have used (like 111, 101) for defining the shapes of the sprites don't correspond to a valid way of defining sprite colors in PuzzleScript. The correct way to define sprites involves using multiple lines where each indicates a row in the sprite. You can use '0' to indicate a cell in the sprite that uses the sprite's primary color (the first color listed after the sprite name) and a space for a transparent cell.

Here's the revised code with correct sprite definitions:
