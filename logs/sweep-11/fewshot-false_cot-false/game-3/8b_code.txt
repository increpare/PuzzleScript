### Corrections Made:
1. **Sprite matrices**: Adjusted the `Player`, `Block`, `Target`, and `TargetBlock` sprite matrices to have consistent designations with the object functionality expected (ensuring each object has a distinguishable setup).

2. **Sound section**: Completely removed the `SOUNDS` section since it was empty, to align with the classic PuzzleScript template instructions when not using sound.

3. **Rules syntax**: Fixed the `WinCondition` clause from `All Target on TargetBlock` to `All TargetBlock on Target`, ensuring the game logic correctly identifies the win state when all targets are covered by target blocks.

Please ensure these corrections are consistent with your intentions for game behavior and adjust if necessary.
