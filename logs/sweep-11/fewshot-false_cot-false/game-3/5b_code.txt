Certainly! Let's address the issues in the given PuzzleScript game code.

1. **Sprite Matrix for Player Object:** The `Player` object definition uses three lines of dots for its sprite but misses a formatted grid. We need consistent dimensions for all rows of the sprite.

2. **Legend Definitions:** Each line in the legend should use the equals (`=`) symbol to define legends. Instead of spacing with no operator, each must equate the term to the object name properly.

Here's the corrected version:

- Corrected the Legend section with appropriate use of the equals (`=`) symbol to define the mappings.
