To repair the errors highlighted in the given PuzzleScript game code, we must address two primary issues:

1. The "Trying to access color number 1 from the color palette of sprite WALL, but there are only 1 defined in it." errors are caused by incorrectly defining the color data of the WALL sprite. The WALL sprite is supposed to use more than one color, but it's defined using only one color (black). To fix this, either ensure the WALL uses a single color or use a darker shade to maintain a consistent visual style.

2. The unexpected sound token error indicates a problem with the syntax for defining and calling sound effects. This must be corrected by ensuring sound identifiers do not conflict with function names and are defined correctly in the context of PuzzleScript.

With these issues in mind, let's amend the code:

### Fix Summary
- **Wall Sprite:** Changed the grayscale color scheme to ensure only one color is used uniformly across the Wall sprite to avoid accessing non-existent colors.
- **Sound Effects:** Renamed `collect` and `playermove` to `collectSound` and `moveSound` to resolve naming and syntax issues, ensuring the sounds are properly recognized and invoked when those actions occur.
