To address the compilation errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to make several adjustments:

1. **Define Sounds Properly:** The `SOUNDS` section should define the mapping between sound events and sound assets, but the provided code is defining them with arbitrary numbers. We need to specify actual sound event keywords like `PlayerMove` and `PlayerCollect` instead, and these will require corresponding assets.

2. **Correct Sound Usage in Rules:** The rules should be modified to use the correct sound event keywords defined in the `SOUNDS` section.

3. **Fix Level Definitions:** Ensure that the level definitions use only the objects defined in the `LEGEND`.

Here's the corrected code:

```

**Explanation:**
- **SOUNDS Definition:** Corrected sound labels such as `PlayerCollect` and `PlayerMove` must relate to identifiable assets. In a typical scenario, you would ensure these numbers correspond to actual sound assets.
- **Rule Sounds:** Updated `sound_player_collect` and `sound_player_move` in the rules to match the corrected labels.
- **Levels:** Ensure the levels reference only valid symbols (`P`, `G`, `#`, `.`) as defined in the `LEGEND`. The initial definitions were using `L` and `E`, which were undefined.

Note: The `PlayerMove` sound will play whenever the player successfully moves (including into empty space), and `PlayerCollect` will play when collecting a gem.
