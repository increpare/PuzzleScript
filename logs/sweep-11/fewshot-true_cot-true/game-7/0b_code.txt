To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define the game's title, author, and homepage and then proceed to define the objects, rules, collision layers, win conditions, and levels. Here's a systematic approach to creating a simple PuzzleScript game:

### Game Concept
Let's create a simple Sokoban-style game where the player needs to push crates into designated target areas. Here's a brief outline:
- **Player (P):** The entity the player controls.
- **Crate (C):** The box that can be pushed.
- **Wall (#):** Impassable obstacles.
- **Target (T):** Destination spot for the crate.
- **Background (.):** Free space.

### Plan

1. **Title, Author, and Meta Information:** This is where we define the core details and any optional metadata like homepage.
2. **Objects:** Define each item that will appear in the game grid: Player, Wall, Crate, Target, and Background.
3. **Legend:** Assign a shorthand notation for each object.
4. **Collision Layers:** Define which objects can overlap with others.
5. **Rules:** Define how objects interact, specifically how the player pushes crates.
6. **Win Conditions:** The condition to win the game is having all crates on the targets.
7. **Levels:** Define grid-based levels that the player must solve.

### Explanation

- **Objects:** We define the visual and behavioral characteristics of each object.
- **Legend:** Represents each object with a shorthand to make levels easy to read.
- **Collision Layers:** Establish which objects can exist in the same space or block each other.
- **Rules:** 
  - The player can push crates, and crates are marked as "on target" when they reach a target.
  - CrateOnTarget simplifies win condition checks by existing only when a crate is truly over a target.
- **Win Conditions:** The game checks for all crates to be on targets for the player to win.
- **Levels:** Customized level design predefines a grid layout representing the environment and challenges. 

You can expand this game by adding more levels, different mechanics such as undo functionality, and sound for interactive feedback.
