To address the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript code, several corrections are necessary:

1. **Sprite Dimensions**: All sprites in PuzzleScript must be 5x5 pixels. The provided sprites are 3x3 pixels or incorrectly sized, which needs correction.

2. **Level Rectangularity**: All rows within a level definition must be the same length. The provided level rows have inconsistent lengths.

3. **Rule Symmetry**: The number of entities in the patterns on the left and right sides of a rule must match; the existing rules don't satisfy this requirement due to an oversight, specifically the Crate and No Crate situation handling.

Here's the corrected version of the game code that addresses these issues:

**Corrections**:
- **Sprite Graphics**: All sprites resized to 5x5.
- **Level Rectangularity**: Adjusted rows to have the same lengths by adding/removing spaces as needed.
- **Rule Symmetry**: Ensured rules have a matching pattern length on both sides by ensuring that an empty space (represented as an absent character) is denoted every time a pattern expects a Crate move to a specific space. 

These modifications ensure the code adheres to the PuzzleScript language constraints.
