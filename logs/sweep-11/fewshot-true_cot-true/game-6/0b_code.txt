Creating a PuzzleScript game requires several components, such as defining the game's objects, rules, and win conditions. Here's an outline to help ensure a clear approach to developing a new game:

### Plan of Action:
1. **Conceptualization**: Decide on a game concept. PuzzleScript games are often simple, involving movement, pushing objects, or sequences to solve puzzles.
2. **Objects**: Define objects and their appearances in the game.
3. **Legend**: Create shorthand notations for objects to simplify level design.
4. **Collision Layers**: Establish interactions between different game layers.
5. **Rules**: Develop rules for object interactions, including movement, pushing, and other mechanics.
6. **Win Conditions**: Specify what conditions need to be met to win the game.
7. **Levels**: Design a few levels to demonstrate gameplay.

For this game, I will design a simple Sokoban-like game where a player has to push boxes onto target spots.

### Game Concept:
- The player needs to push all crates onto designated target spaces to win.
- The player can only move in four directions and push one crate at a time.

### Game Code:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined a player, walls, crates, targets, and crates on targets.
- **Legend**: Created shorthand for easier level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensured layers are properly scrolling together for seamless interaction.
- **Rules**: Included player movement, crate pushing mechanics, and conditions aligning crates onto targets.
- **Win Conditions**: Win the game when all crates are on targets.
- **Levels**: Designed an example level layout to demonstrate the game concept.

This game provides a simple puzzle-solving experience requiring logical thinking and strategic movement to align the crates with the targets.
