To address the errors:

1. **Wall Color Definition**: The error messages regarding the Wall object indicate that there's a mismatch in the color definition. Each sprite's bitmap pattern in PuzzleScript must have a corresponding color definition for each layer of the sprite, where layers are defined as distinct numbers in the pattern. Since "Wall" currently has only one color defined (`#0000FF` for "Blue") but uses two numbers (`1`s in the pattern), we must define two colors. If you intended Wall to be a solid color, you should define it with only one number in the pattern or ensure that two colors are defined.

2. **Rectangular Map Requirement**: The error messages about the level's rectangularity suggest that not all lines in the level map are of equal length. The lines must be padded so they are the same length.

Let's address these issues in the repaired version of the game code below:

I fixed the Wall object color to use only one color index by repeating the one it has, which aligns with five `1`s in the pattern. Additionally, the level is reformatted to be rectangular by ensuring each row is the same length.
