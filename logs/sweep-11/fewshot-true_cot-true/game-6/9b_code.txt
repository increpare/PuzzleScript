To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to take the following steps:

1. **Color Palette Error for "Wall":** The errors in lines 26-30 indicate that the `Wall` object is attempting to use a second color (`#11111`) when only one color is defined in its color palette. PuzzleScript typically expects colors to be defined as a list separated by spaces. As the object's "Wall" graphics are all the same, we can correct this by providing a two-tone color to satisfy the potential intended design.

2. **Map Rectangularity Error:** The errors in lines 108-112 indicate that the map levels aren't rectangular, i.e., each row must have the same number of columns. This means that we must ensure that all lines in the level have the same length, either by adding spaces or by adjusting the length of existing rows.

Now, let's update the code:

1. Update `Wall` objects to have a proper two-color definition matching the potential intent of the original code.
2. Make sure the level has uniformly sized rows.

Here's the revised code:

```

### Changes Made:
1. **Wall Object:** Added a second color to the `Wall` object to have a valid two-tone color setup.
2. **Levels Section:** Filled out a single trailing level row with `#`s to ensure all level rows have the same length, making the grid rectangular.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the logic of the original Sokoban-style game.
