To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, here's a breakdown of the issues and solutions:

1. **Color Palette for Target Object**:
   The errors related to the Target object suggest incorrect color definitions. Each color should be on a separate line with a hex value. In this case, the object had improper color indexing – we need to define multiple colors properly.

2. **Rule Syntax**:
   There were syntax issues in defining rules, specifically the absence of arrows and correctly matched left-hand side and right-hand side patterns.

3. **Level Rectangularity**:
   Levels must be rectangular with each row having the same number of columns. We need to fix the levels by aligning all rows.

Here is the corrected code:

```
Changes made:
- Fixed the `Target` object's invalid color definition (giving it proper structure).
- Corrected all the rule syntax issues, ensuring there were arrows and proper pattern matching.
- Fixed the level so each row has an equal number of characters, making the grid rectangular.
