To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the color palette definitions for the "Wall" and "Target" objects. The errors indicate that we're trying to use color indices in these objects that don't exist in their sprite definitions.

Here's the plan:
1. **Wall Object**:
   - Currently, the wall object is defined with a single color `Blue` but is using a pattern that expects three separate colors (`111`).
   - Update the wall object to use only one pattern to match the number of colors defined or define additional colors.

2. **Target Object**:
   - Similarly, the target object is using a three-color pattern `333`.
   - Update the target object to use only one color in the pattern or define a palette with three colors.

Then I'll integrate these corrections into the overall structure of the code:

```

Changes made:
- For `Wall`, added a proper color palette with a single color and adjusted it to match one color.
- For `Target`, added multiple colors to match the pattern. This allows the usage of repeated colors effectively, adapting the previous pattern properly.
- Applied the same new consistent color style to `CrateOnTarget` and `Crate`, as needed ensuring smoother visual integration with the overall design.

This should address the compilation errors related to color indices.
