To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to understand the complaints from the console output. The errors indicate that the color numbers specified in the `Wall` and `Crate` objects exceed the number of colors defined. For each sprite, the number of unique colors should match the number of colors used in its representation.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Check Object Color Definitions**: The `Wall` and `Crate` objects must have color codes aligned with their pixel representations. 
2. **Correct Color Definitions**:
   - For `Wall`, the definition should accommodate the color indices used in its pixel pattern, needing exactly three colors.
   - For `Crate`, its pattern requires that exactly three colors are defined (Brown multiple times for uniqueness, if needed).
3. **Verify Sprite Representation**: Ensure each object’s representation matches its color palette size.

Now, we implement these corrections:

This updated code ensures all sprite definitions include the right number of colors for their palette, fixing the compilation issues mentioned in the console output.
