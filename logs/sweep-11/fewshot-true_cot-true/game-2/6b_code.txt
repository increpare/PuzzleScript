Certainly, the key issue with the levels is that the crates (C) need to have a clear path and be pushed onto a target (O). Let's ensure that each level is at least potentially solvable by positioning the crates and targets correctly.

In these adjustments:
- Level 0: Positioned the crate so it can be pushed onto the target.
- Level 1: Moved the target directly below the crate to allow the player to push it there.
- Level 2: Made sure the crate can be pushed onto the target by moving crates towards targets. 

This configuration should ensure each level is now solvable.
