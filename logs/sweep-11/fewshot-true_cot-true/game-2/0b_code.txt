To output a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll first outline the plan:

1. **Conceptualize the Game**: I'll create a simple Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player pushes crates onto target spots. The game objective is to push all crates onto specific target locations.

2. **Define Game Elements**:
   - **Background**: The base layer of the game.
   - **Player**: The character that the player controls.
   - **Crate**: The object that the player can push.
   - **Target**: The goal location for crates.
   - **Wall**: Impassable boundaries for objects.

3. **Set Up Rules and Win Conditions**:
   - Rules for movement of the player.
   - Rules for pushing crates and preventing crates from pushing through walls.
   - Define win conditions when all crates are on target spots.

4. **Create Levels**: Design a few levels with varying difficulty.

5. **Code Implementation**: Implement the above elements and logic into a PuzzleScript template.

Now let's write the full PuzzleScript code for the game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined the game pieces with basic appearances. The wall uses a grey color, a standard practice to show impassable areas.
- **Legend**: Simplified representations for game pieces.
- **Rules**: Implemented basic pushing mechanics, ensuring crates cannot move through walls or other crates improperly.
- **Win Conditions**: The player wins when all crates (`C`) are on targets (`O`).
- **Levels**: Designed a few different layouts to provide variation and challenge.

This code represents a classic Sokoban-style game with multiple levels, offering players different puzzles to solve in each level.
