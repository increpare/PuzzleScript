To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Game Concept**: We will create a simple puzzle game where the player needs to push crates onto target spots. The player can move around in a maze-like environment and can only push crates, not pull them. The goal will be to place all crates on target spots.

2. **Design the Game Elements**:
   - **Background**: The base layer of the game.
   - **Wall**: Solid obstacles that neither the player nor the crates can pass through.
   - **Player**: The main character controlled by the player.
   - **Crate**: Objects that can be pushed by the player into target spots.
   - **Target**: Specific locations where crates need to be placed.

3. **Write the Legend**: This section assigns symbols to each object used in the levels.

4. **Develop the Collision Layers**: Ensure that objects that interact are placed within the appropriate layers.

5. **Design the Rules**: Outline the movement and interaction rules for the player and crates.

6. **Set Win Conditions**: Define conditions under which a player wins the game.

7. **Create Levels**: Design at least one level to demonstrate the game mechanics.

8. **Verify Game Playability**: Confirm that all elements work together to create a fun and functional game.

Here is the complete code for the game:

**Explanation**:
- The code includes all the necessary elements: game objects, a legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels.
- The player (`P`) pushes the crate (`C`) onto the target (`O`) in a simple level.
- Walls (`#`) serve as boundaries for movement. The win condition is achieved when all crates are on targets.
