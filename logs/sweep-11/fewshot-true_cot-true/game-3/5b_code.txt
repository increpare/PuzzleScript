To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to address the following issues based on the console output message:
1. **Line 47 Error**: This error relates to a misplaced or incorrect reference that the parser is identifying as a sound event or object name issue, but in reality, the likely culprit is a mismatch in the collision layers where Target should not have been included in such a way.
2. **Line 62 Error**: This error is because the use of comments (inline comments using `#`) in the rules section is not allowed in PuzzleScript. Each rule must be in its own line without additional text.

Given these points, the best plan of action is:
- Fix the comments in the rules section, so they do not interfere with compilation.
- Check collision layers adjustment if needed to adhere to collision rules properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```

The main adjustments are:
- Removed inline comments from within rules, as they were being parsed incorrectly.
- Adjusted the collision layers section to properly reflect how Target should interact.
- Clarified rules for maintaining BoxOnTarget state when moving onto and staying on targets.
