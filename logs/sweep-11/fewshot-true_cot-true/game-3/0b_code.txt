To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to define several components:

1. **Title and Metadata**: This section will include the title of the game, the author, and possibly a homepage.

2. **Objects**: Define the different objects or entities that will appear in the game. These include the player, walls, targets, and any other interactive elements.

3. **Legend**: This maps shorthand symbols to objects for easier level design.

4. **Sounds**: Define any sound effects that will be triggered by game events.

5. **Collision Layers**: Specify how objects are layered and interact with each other.

6. **Rules**: Determine how objects interact when moved or when specific conditions are met.

7. **Win Conditions**: Outline the criteria for winning a level, such as reaching a target or collecting items.

8. **Levels**: Design the layout of levels using the shorthand symbols defined in the legend.

Based on this plan, I'll create a simple PuzzleScript game where the objective is for the player to push boxes onto targets (similar to Sokoban).

**Game Description**:
- The player character ("P") is tasked with pushing all the "Box" ("B") objects onto "Targets" ("O").
- "Walls" ("#") are obstacles that can't be moved.
- When a "Box" is on a "Target", it becomes a "BoxOnTarget" ("@").
- The win condition is met when all boxes are placed on targets.

This game captures the essence of a simplistic Sokoban-style puzzle game, where strategic movement and planning are key to solving each level.
