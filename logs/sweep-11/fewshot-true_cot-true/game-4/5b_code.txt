In order to fix the unsolvable level 0, make sure that the Player can reach all Coins without getting trapped or blocked by Walls. Specifically, check for any inaccessible or boxed-in Coins and adjust Wall placements or remove redundant blocks. If necessary, reposition the Player or add corridors to connect segregated areas.
