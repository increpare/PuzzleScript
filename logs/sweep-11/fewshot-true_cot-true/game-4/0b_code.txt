Creating a PuzzleScript game involves defining the objects, rules, win conditions, and levels that make up the game. Here's the plan for creating a simple PuzzleScript game:

1. **Define the theme and goal:** As a fun and easy game, let's create a game where the player collects all coins in a maze to win. The player will move around a grid, avoiding traps and collecting coins.

2. **Objects:**
   - Background: Represents empty space.
   - Player: The character controlled by the player.
   - Wall: An immovable object that blocks the player's path.
   - Coin: Collectible items that the player needs to win.
   - Trap: An object that causes the player to lose the game if touched.

3. **Rules:**
   - The player can move in all four cardinal directions unless blocked by a wall.
   - The player collects a coin by moving onto it.
   - The player loses if they move onto a trap.

4. **Win conditions:**
   - The game is won when all coins are collected.
   - The game is lost if the player moves onto a trap.

5. **Levels:** Design a few simple levels to demonstrate the game mechanics.

Here is the complete PuzzleScript code for this game:
