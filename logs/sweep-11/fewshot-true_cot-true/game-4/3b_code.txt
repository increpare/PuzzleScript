To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the unexpected tokens and provide proper implementation of sounds. The errors in the original code stem from incorrect use and definition of sound tokens. In PuzzleScript, sound tokens need to be associated with specific hexadecimal sound IDs, which are not provided in the original script. Here's how we can correct this:

1. **Define Sounds Properly**: In the provided code, sound tokens like `CollectCoin` and `HitTrap` are used without being defined in the `SOUNDS` section. We need to assign hexadecimal sound IDs to these sound actions.
   
2. **Correct the Syntax in the Rules**: The syntax `[ > Player | Coin ] -> [ > Player | ] sound CollectCoin` should be `[ > Player | Coin ] -> [ > Player | ] sfx0` where `sfx0` corresponds to the defined sound from the `SOUNDS` section. Similarly for the `HitTrap` sound.

Below is the corrected version of the code with all changes implemented:

This corrected version includes the appropriate sound definitions with hexadecimal IDs and assigns them as `sfx0` for coin collection and `sfx1` for hitting a trap. The rules section is updated to use these sound identifiers correctly.
