(For making maps easily: uncomment out the next few lines + press action to discard all boundaries and recreate them)

( [ action player ] [ Crate_connection ] -> [ action player ] [ ] )
( up [ action player ] [ Crate | Crate ] -> [ action player ] [ Crate Crate_u | Crate Crate_d ] )
( right [ action player ] [ Crate | Crate ] -> [ action player ] [ Crate Crate_r | Crate Crate_l ] )


(Step 1: propagate motions forward)
[ > Pusher | Pushable ] -> [ > Pusher | > Pushable ]
+ up [ moving Crate Crate_U | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_U | moving Crate ]
+ down [ moving Crate Crate_D | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_D | moving Crate ]
+ left [ moving Crate Crate_L | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_L | moving Crate ]
+ right [ moving Crate Crate_R | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_R | moving Crate ]


(Step 1: If a crate can't move, we have to back-propagate the can't-move-ness, including possibly through players)
[ > Solid | wall ] -> [ Solid | wall ]

[ > Solid | stationary Solid ] -> [ Solid | Solid ]
+ up [ moving Crate Crate_U | stationary Crate ] -> [ Crate Crate_U | Crate ]
+ down [ moving Crate Crate_D | stationary Crate ] -> [ Crate Crate_D | Crate ]
+ left [ moving Crate Crate_L | stationary Crate ] -> [ Crate Crate_L | Crate ]
+ right [ moving Crate Crate_R | stationary Crate ] -> [ Crate Crate_R | Crate ]


(Step 3: Mark all crates that are still moving as possibly being able to move)
[ moving Pushable ] -> [ Pushable CanMove ]

(Step 4: redo Step 1, but only through things that are marked as being possibly able to move)
[ > Pusher | CanMove Pushable ] -> [ > Pusher | CanMove > Pushable ]
+ up [ moving Crate Crate_U | CanMove Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_U | CanMove moving Crate ]
+ down [ moving Crate Crate_D | CanMove Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_D | CanMove moving Crate ]
+ left [ moving Crate Crate_L | CanMove Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_L | CanMove moving Crate ]
+ right [ moving Crate Crate_R | CanMove Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_R | CanMove moving Crate ]

(Step 5: remove all the CanMove tags)
[ CanMove ] -> [ ]

(Step 6: move connections along with the crates themselves)
[ moving Crate stationary Crate_connection ] -> [ moving Crate moving Crate_connection ]
