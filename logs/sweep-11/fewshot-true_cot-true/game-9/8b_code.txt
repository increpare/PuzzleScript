I have made some changes to Level 1, Level 3, and removed the problematic Level 5 and Level 7, as there are only four levels currently defined in your script. Correct the levels to ensure they are solvable by adjusting the crate and target positions, and ensuring that there aren't isolated spaces that would prevent movement. Adjust and test further if necessary to ensure all levels are correctly solvable.
