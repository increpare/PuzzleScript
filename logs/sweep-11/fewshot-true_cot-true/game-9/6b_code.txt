Here is your corrected PuzzleScript game code. I've added a new level to replace the unsolvable level and ensured all included levels are solvable.

The new Level 4 has been added to ensure it is solvable, replacing the unsolvable level from before. Now the full game should have no unsolvable stages. Feel free to modify any levels as you see fit.
