The error messages indicate that there are issues with the `Crate` object in the game code. Specifically, the problem stems from the definition of the `Crate` object where it tries to use a secondary color index "1" without defining a second color in the palette. Here's the plan to fix these issues:

1. **Define a Second Color for the Crate:** Since the Crate sprite uses color index "1", we need to ensure it has more than one color defined. We will add another color to the `Crate` object.

2. **Verify and Correct the Game Code:** After fixing the Crate color issue, ensure the rest of the syntax and logic structure of the game is correctly formatted. 

With this in mind, here is the corrected version of the code:

### Changes Made:
- **Crate Object:** Added a second color (`DarkBrown`) to the `Crate` object to ensure it has a secondary color during rendering.

With the color issues resolved, the game should compile without errors, allowing players to enjoy the "Maze Adventure" game.
