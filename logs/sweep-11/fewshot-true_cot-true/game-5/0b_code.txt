To output the code for a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll follow the template and structure commonly used in PuzzleScript games. Before writing the code, let's outline a basic plan:

1. **Title and Metadata**: Set the title and author information for the game.
2. **Objects**: Define the game objects, including the background, player, and other interactive elements like walls or targets.
3. **Legend**: Define symbols to represent each of the objects created.
4. **Sounds**: Optionally define sounds for interactions (not mandatory for functionality).
5. **Collision Layers**: Organize objects into layers that define their interaction priorities.
6. **Rules**: Establish the game mechanics and interaction rules between objects.
7. **Win Conditions**: Specify the win conditions for the game.
8. **Levels**: Design initial levels that showcase the game's mechanics.

Given these criteria, I'll create a straightforward block-pushing puzzle game, similar to a traditional Sokoban variation, where players push crates onto predefined targets.

**Explanation:**
- **Title and Author**: The game is called "Simple Crate Pusher," with author set as "PuzzleDesigner."
- **Objects**: Five objects are defined: Background, Wall, Player, Crate, and Target. Each has a unique color and pixel pattern.
- **Legend**: Characters are used to symbolize these objects in level design.
- **Sounds**: Optionally added sound for crate movement.
- **Collision Layers**: Determine how objects interact; walls block movement, crates can be pushed, etc.
- **Rules**: The main rule allows players to push crates in the direction they move.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all targets have crates on them.
- **Levels**: A simple level is defined using the legend characters.

This setup should allow players to push crates into targets, solving levels by strategically moving crates using the player's character.
