The errors in the console output highlight issues related to the `LEGEND` section of the PuzzleScript code. The problems are caused by the fact that the legend definitions are currently in the wrong format. In PuzzleScript, items in the `LEGEND` section must be defined using the equals symbol (`=`) to associate character representations with object names.

To fix these issues, I'll provide a corrected version of the `LEGEND` section. Here is the plan of action:

1. Replace each line in the `LEGEND` section by correctly associating each character with a corresponding game object using the `=` symbol. This means converting lines like `= Wall` to the correct format.

2. Verify that no errors are present elsewhere in the code after fixing the `LEGEND`.

Now, let's correct the code:

I've corrected the `LEGEND` section by using the `=` symbol to denote each association between the character and the objects. Now, the code should compile without issues related to the legend format.
