The errors in the PuzzleScript code are related to inconsistencies in the level map. Specifically, each row of the map must be of equal length to ensure that the map is rectangular, as required by the PuzzleScript engine. Additionally, spaces are not a recognized symbol unless defined in the OBJECTS or LEGEND section. We'll resolve the rectangular map issue by either padding with known symbols equally or adjusting its content to fit a consistent width.

Here's the plan:
1. Identify the longest row in the level map to determine the intended width.
2. Pad shorter rows with the background symbol '.' until they match the width of the longest row.
3. Ensure there are no undefined symbols, such as spaces, used in the level.

Let's write the corrected code:

```

In the above code, the second row "#T..T#" was padded with a '.' at the end to make it the same length as the longest row, which is 7 characters. This adjustment ensures that the map is rectangular, as required by PuzzleScript. Also, note that only symbols defined in the LEGEND (like '.', '#', 'P', 'B', 'T', and 'O') are used in the level map, resolving the undefined symbol issue.
