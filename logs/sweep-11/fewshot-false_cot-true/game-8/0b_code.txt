To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll need to consider a few key elements that make up a game in this language. The main components of a PuzzleScript game are:

1. **Objects**: Defining the elements that will be visible on screen.
2. **Legend**: Connecting single-character symbols to each object for easier level creation.
3. **Sounds**: Defining any sounds to be used (optional).
4. **Collision Layers**: Specifying which objects can interact with each other.
5. **Rules**: Defining how objects interact or transform in response to player actions.
6. **Win Conditions**: Setting conditions that determine when a level is completed.
7. **Levels**: Designing the levels themselves using a grid of symbols defined in the legend.
8. **Metadata**: Including details like the title and authorship.

Let's create a simple Sokoban-style game where the player pushes boxes onto targets.

### Plan
1. **Objects**: Define a player, wall, box, target, and floor.
2. **Legend**: Assign symbols to each object.
3. **Collision Layers**: Set up layers for player, boxes, and others.
4. **Rules**: Create simple rules for moving, pushing boxes, and win state.
5. **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all boxes are on targets.
6. **Levels**: Build a basic level to test the mechanics.
7. **Metadata**: Add game title and author.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code for this idea:

### Explanation
- **Objects**: These define our game elements visually and their attributes (like color).
- **Legend**: Maps simple characters to objects for easy level writing.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensures objects don't occupy the same space incorrectly. Boxes are treated separately from other objects.
- **Rules**: Allows for box pushing and maintains the state of boxes on targets.
- **Win Conditions**: Checks if all the boxes are on the targets, which triggers level completion.
- **Levels**: A simple level layout where the player can test the game's mechanics.

This provides a fundamental Sokoban-like game. You can elaborate further by adding more levels or tweaking win conditions and mechanics as desired.
