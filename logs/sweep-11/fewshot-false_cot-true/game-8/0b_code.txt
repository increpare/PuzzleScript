To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to follow several key steps. Firstly, let's outline the basic components of a PuzzleScript game:

1. **Title and Author**: Define who created the game.
2. **Game Objects**: Specify the objects that will be used in the game.
3. **Collision Layers**: Arrange objects in layers to handle interaction logic.
4. **Legend**: Define the symbols representing game objects in levels.
5. **Sounds**: Define sound effects for player actions.
6. **Rules**: Specify what happens each turn or in response to certain actions.
7. **Win Conditions**: Establish what conditions must be met to win each level.
8. **Levels**: Design the levels where the game will be played.

For this example, let's make a simple Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player pushes crates to target locations. Here's how we can implement this:

### Plan:
- **Title**: "Simple Sokoban"
- **Author**: "Game Designer"
- **Objects**: Player, Wall, Crate, Target, Floor
- **Collision Layers**: Separate player, crates, and static elements (walls, floors)
- **Legend**: Define concise symbols for each game object
- **Rules**: Allow the player to push crates, and handle movements
- **Win Conditions**: All crates must be on target locations
- **Levels**: Three simple levels increasing in complexity

### Code:

This game features a grid-based movement where the player can push crates ('C') onto target locations ('X'). The win condition is met when all crates are on targets. The levels are designed to progressively introduce the player to pushing mechanics and spatial reasoning. The rules delineate how interaction between player and crate occurs, and each object's graphical representation and collision properties are defined appropriately.
