To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to make the following corrections:

1. **Color Specification Error**: The error concerning the color "beige" indicates that it is not a recognized color in PuzzleScript. We'll need to change the color for the "Floor" object to a valid color, such as "lightgrey".

2. **Section Order Error**: PuzzleScript requires that sections be in a specific order. The "COLLISIONLAYERS" section should come after the "OBJECTS" and "LEGEND" sections but before the "SOUNDS" section. We'll rearrange the sections accordingly.

3. **Legend Definitions**: The error messages about "BACKGROUND," "STATIC," and "MOVABLE" suggest that these have not been defined in the "LEGEND" section. Let's define them to resolve this issue.

4. **Invalid Rule Syntax**: The issue with '====' indicates a syntax error in the 'WIN' section. The comment should immediately follow the '==='.

Here is the corrected version of your game code:

**Notes**:
- The `Background`, `Static`, and `Movable` labels are placeholders for clarity, keeping in line with how layers are usually managed. In actual use, you might adjust which objects belong to which layers based on how your game's physics should behave.
- Added layer assignments in `COLLISIONLAYERS` according to typical game layer use.
- Changed `Floor`'s color to "lightgrey" to fix the unrecognized color error.
