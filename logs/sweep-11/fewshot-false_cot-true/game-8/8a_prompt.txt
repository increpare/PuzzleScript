=================================
line 40 : Was looking for color for object FLOOR, got "beige" instead.
line 48 : section "COLLISIONLAYERS" is out of order, must follow  "SOUNDS" (or it could be that the section "SOUNDS"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 50 : Cannot add "BACKGROUND" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
line 51 : Cannot add "STATIC" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
line 52 : Cannot add "MOVABLE" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
line 58 : Only comments should go after a bunch of equals signs ('===') on a line.
