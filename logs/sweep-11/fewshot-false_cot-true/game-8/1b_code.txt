To address the errors presented in the console output, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Correct Section Order and Missing Sections**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should appear after the `SOUNDS` section, even if the `SOUNDS` section is empty.

2. **Define Missing Collision Layer Objects**: The game refers to collision layers named `Targets` and `Crates`, which are not defined in the `LEGEND` section. We need to fix this by declaring these objects properly in the `LEGEND`.

3. **Correct the Object References in Rules**: The `RULES` section fails because it references objects in lowercase, whereas object names are case-sensitive. We need to ensure all objects in the rules use the correct case.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

### Changes Made:

- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section.
- Corrected the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to include all objects properly.
- Updated rule references to use accurate object names (case-sensitive fix for `Player`, `Box`, and `BoxOnTarget`).
