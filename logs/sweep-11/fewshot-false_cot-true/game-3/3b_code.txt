The error messages point out two main issues with the PuzzleScript code:

1. **Section Order**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is stated to be out of order because it should follow a `SOUNDS` section, even if the `SOUNDS` section is empty.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: PuzzleScript is case-sensitive, and object names in the `RULES` section must match those defined in the `OBJECTS` section exactly, including their capitalization.

To fix these issues, we need to:
- Add an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section.
- Correct the capitalization of object names in the `RULES` section to match the definitions in the `OBJECTS` section.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

This should ensure that the game code compiles correctly without errors.
