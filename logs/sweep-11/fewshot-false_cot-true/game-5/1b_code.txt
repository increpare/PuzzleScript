To resolve the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to do the following:

1. **Color Issue**: The error messages indicate a problem with the color assignment for the `Treasure` object. In PuzzleScript, when specifying a color for an object, you must use a recognized color name from the PuzzleScript color palette or hex color codes. `gold` is not a recognized color. We should replace it with a color that exists in the PuzzleScript's default color palette.

2. **Palette Corrections**: The use of `1` indicates that a different number was expected in terms of value since `1` didn't match the colors in the palette. To solve the problem, we have to replace `1` with a number corresponding correctly to a color.

3. **Sound Issue**: Double-quotes are used incorrectly in the `SOUNDS` section. The correct format uses single quotes for JSON-style inclusion within PuzzleScript language, if required. 

By taking these into account, I'll make appropriate corrections to the `Treasure` object definition. I'll choose a color available from the default palette like `orange` for `Treasure`, and use single quotes for sound definitions.

Here is the corrected code:

These changes ensure that the color definitions are correct and the diamond shaped `Treasure` object has the intended coloring and structure. The sounds are also defined correctly with proper syntax.
