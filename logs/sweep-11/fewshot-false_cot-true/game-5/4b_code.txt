The issues in the provided code stem from incorrect use of syntax and missing definitions. We'll address these errors one by one:

1. **Sound Definition Error**: Sound effects (`SFX3`) should be defined correctly. In the `RULES` section, sound events are typically used immediately after certain conditions.

2. **Level Divider Error**: The semicolons `;` used before the level descriptions are incorrect. Levels should start directly without any additional characters.

3. **Level Row Length Mismatch**: Some levels have rows of differing lengths. Ensuring that all levels are rectangular in shape and that each row has consistent length is essential.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation:

- The semicolon (`;`) preceding the level numbers was removed as it is not needed; levels follow directly after `LEVELS`.
- Each level is corrected to have equal row lengths, ensuring that they are rectangular.
- The sound definitions have been clarified, utilizing an example with `CLICK` for treasure collection, ensuring `SFX3` is correctly referenced in the `SOUNDS` section, though it may not be used directly in this context.

This code should now compile correctly without errors.
