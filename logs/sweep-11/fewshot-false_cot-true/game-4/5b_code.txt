The error messages indicate issues with the object sprite definitions, possibly due to incorrect dimensions or characters. In PuzzleScript, each sprite must be a 5x5 grid of characters, representing colors or blank spaces. The colors used in the code (like `@`, `#`, `C`, `G`, `O`) need to be defined appropriately, typically with some color other than `red`, `grey`, `yellow`, `black`, `green`, or `orange`, unless each represents a character explicitly defined that will be visible. 

Firstly, it seems that there is an issue with the use of certain characters in the sprite matrices (like `@`, `#`, etc.), which might not be directly defined as part of the color palette of PuzzleScript. However, given the plain colors language from the main script, I'll replace those symbols with characters that correspond to each specified color. Since the specification does not include any characters for color values and generally accepts formats like letters which are specified to match the colors, I'll acknowledge these issues likely relate to representation difficulties and aim to fix them with more traditionally-accepted symbol sets, such as A-Z letters.

Here's an approach for correcting the issues:
1. Define symbols associated with color values properly if they were intended for specific representation.
2. Ensure each object sprite adheres to the 5x5 grid rule and uses recognizable characters like `a-e` for color placeholder and ensures consistency with game expectations.
3. Ensure no undefined symbols are used in the sprite matrix.

Let's fix this and re-write the game code:

I altered the characters within the sprite matrices to be consistent with PuzzleScript usage and 5x5 size. Ensure that every color character sequence used for object representation is correctly adhering to PuzzleScript's format, avoiding typical non-letter symbols which might cause trouble due to the syntax rule that expects designated object details.
