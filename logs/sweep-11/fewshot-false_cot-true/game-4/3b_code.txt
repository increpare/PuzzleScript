The main issue here is that the sprite definitions for objects are incorrect. PuzzleScript requires each object to be defined with a 5x5 pixel grid, but in this case, the characters used (e.g., `@`, `#`, `C`, `G`, `O`) extend beyond the 5x5 grid specification. Another issue is that the same object's character can't be redefined in the legend section. 
To fix this, we need to adjust the sprite grids for each object to fit a 5x5 pixel grid and ensure there are no redefinitions in the legend section. I will replace the symbols in the legend that are causing the duplicates, and adjust the object definitions to use a proper 5x5 grid.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Key changes:
- The sprite definitions for `Player`, `Crate`, and `Goal` have been adjusted to fit within a 5x5 grid.
- Character redefinition conflicts in the legend section were addressed by preventing duplicate definitions and adjusting legend symbols.
- Crates are represented by `R`, Player by `P`, and CrateOnGoal by `Y`. 

Now, this should compile without error, given that it abides by the PuzzleScript constraints and resolves redefinition and object sprite size issues.
