To address the issues reported in the console output, we need to make several changes to the game code.

1. **Sprite Dimensions & Naming:** The error message on lines involving object definitions suggests that the sprites might not be right or recognizable. The hint suggests that either sprite dimensions have to be corrected or that the naming conventions are not met. PuzzleScript requires that sprites be 5x5 grids, so I will correct the representation of each object to match this requirement.
   
2. **Duplicate Legend Entries:** The names for "C," "G," and "O" appear to be reused, as indicated by the error messages. These represent abbreviations used in the Legend section that conflict with the object symbols. The sprite naming and legend symbols need to match object definitions, so I will adjust these accordingly.

3. **Sections Order:** The error on line 45 indicates that the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section is out of order and should follow a "SOUNDS" section, even if empty. I will include an empty "SOUNDS" section.

4. **Background Declaration Error:** The "COLLISIONLAYERS" section has "Background," which wasn't defined. I will ensure that the correct usage of layers is maintained.

5. **Unrecognized Name in Rules:** The error at line 55 suggests that the rule references a name that isn't recognized due to capitalization discrepancies. I will standardize the object names throughout the script for consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

These changes should address the major errors reported, which primarily concerned incorrect sprite definitions, legend naming conflicts, and section order in the PuzzleScript game description.
