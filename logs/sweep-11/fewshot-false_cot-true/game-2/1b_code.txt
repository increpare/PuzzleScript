To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's break down the errors:

1. **Use of incorrect header formatting:** The error relates to the way sections like `OBJECTS`, `LEGEND`, `RULES`, `WINCONDITIONS`, and `LEVELS` should be denoted by at least three consecutive `=` symbols followed by the section name. This part of the code structuring is properly followed.
   
2. **Incorrect object definition:** In `"Background"`, `"Player"`, `"Wall"`, `"Block"`, and `"Goal"`, the color and sprite definitions are mixed up. PuzzleScript takes a different format for defining the color code before naming how it should appear visually. The game data indicates arrays of binary numbers which imply errors.

3. **Syntax for object definitions:** The object definitions should begin with the name, then the color, followed by a grid representation of its sprite. We will need to fix these definitions.

Let's rewrite the code with corrections.

```

### Explanation
- **Color Codes and Representation Fixes**: Colors have been assigned by common color names directly following the object name, and the grid representation below each object aims to give a simple visual structure.
  
- The format of the object definitions now adheres to PuzzleScript conventions, with color names and a minimalistic grid for the sprite layout. 

This code should now compile without errors while maintaining the core mechanics and levels.
