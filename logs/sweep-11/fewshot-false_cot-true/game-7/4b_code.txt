The errors in the console output suggest that there are issues with the definitions of objects in the initial part of the code. PuzzleScript expects a specific format in the object declarations section, and it seems that it's encountering something unexpected. 

Let's go over the key points and fix the issues:

1. **Object Definition Syntax**: In PuzzleScript, each object is defined with a name, followed by its character representation, and then its color. The syntax for defining objects should be consistent and correctly structured.

2. **Incorrect Object Headers**: The line separating the `Objects` section with `=========`, `Legend`, and other sections is incorrect. The object declarations should not have a `=========`, which is making the compiler read it as part of the object declarations and causing confusion.

3. **Collision Layers and Rules**: These seem fine, but make sure that objects in collision layers are separated correctly.

4. **Win Conditions and Levels**: These sections seem correct based on traditional PuzzleScript syntax.

With these in mind, I'll adjust the code to follow proper PuzzleScript conventions.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
# Title and Author
title Sokoban Simple
author Game Designer

# Objects
Background
yellow

Player
@ 
blue

Wall
# 
black

Box
B 
red

Target
O 
green

BoxOnTarget
G 
yellow

# Legend
. = Background
@ = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
O = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

# Collision Layers
Background
Player
Box, BoxOnTarget
Wall, Target

# Rules
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]
[ BoxOnTarget | ] -> [ | Box ]

# Win Conditions
All BoxOnTarget on Target

# Levels
# Level 1
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######

# Level 2
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######
```

This corrected version removes unnecessary separators and ensures that each object has a clear and concise definition format that meets the PuzzleScript requirements.
