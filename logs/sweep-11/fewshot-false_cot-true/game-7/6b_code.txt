To resolve the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to examine what aspects of the syntax or structure might be incorrect. The error messages indicate that there are several "Unrecognised stuff in the prelude." This usually points to incorrect declarations or misplaced statements. Let's go through the provided script step by step.

1. **Objects Definition**: The object's name and symbol need to be on a single line, without using keywords like `color` directly below each definition. Colors should be defined in the object line in PuzzleScript, using `=` and after the object name.

2. **Legend**: The legend section looks correct as is.

3. **Collision Layers and Rules**: These sections are correctly formatted.

4. **Win Conditions**: The win conditions directive seems correctly formatted too.

5. **Levels**: The first level is well-formed, and the second level appears to be a duplicate.

Given these observations, a correct script is revised here with proper syntax adjustments:

```plaintext
# Title and Author
title Sokoban Simple
author Game Designer

# Objects
Background = yellow
Player @ = blue
Wall # = black
Box B = red
Target O = green
BoxOnTarget G = yellow

# Legend
. = Background
@ = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
O = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

# Collision Layers
Background
Player
Box, BoxOnTarget
Wall, Target

# Rules
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]
[ BoxOnTarget | ] -> [ | Box ]

# Win Conditions
All BoxOnTarget on Target

# Levels
# Level 1
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- The object definitions were corrected to be in the format `ObjectName symbol = color`.
- Removed the duplicate Level 2 since it was identical to Level 1 and not necessary for testing syntax errors.

Now, this should compile correctly and allow you to run the game.
