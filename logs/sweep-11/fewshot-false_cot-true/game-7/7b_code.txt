To rectify the errors reported by the PuzzleScript engine, we should examine the problematic code sections for syntactical or structural mistakes.

The errors indicate issues in the prelude section where object definitions are stated. It seems the problem arises from the way colors are assigned to the objects. In PuzzleScript, colors cannot usually be defined as separate attributes; instead, they should be assigned directly when defining objects.

Let's update the object definitions to group the symbol with the color-code as part of the syntax that PuzzleScript expects. Moreover, the ordering and indentation should conform to typical PuzzleScript structure. Now, let's provide the corrected code.

```plaintext
# Title and Author
title Sokoban Simple
author Game Designer

# Objects
Background . yellow
Player @ blue
Wall # black
Box B red
Target O green
BoxOnTarget G yellow

# Legend
. = Background
@ = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
O = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

# Collision Layers
Background
Player
Box, BoxOnTarget
Wall, Target

# Rules
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]
[ BoxOnTarget | ] -> [ | Box ]

# Win Conditions
All BoxOnTarget on Target

# Levels
# Level 1
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######
```

Here's what was changed:
- I corrected the object definitions by including the symbols in a single line object definition with their respective colors, such as `Background . yellow`, which adheres to the proper syntax for PuzzleScript.
   
Once these corrections are applied, the game script should compile without the syntax errors the console initially reported.
