The errors primarily arise from two concerns: the issue with the handling of space characters in the levels and incorrect syntax in movement rules.

1. **Space in Levels:**
   In PuzzleScript, you must represent empty spaces using a defined object, typically `Background` here, represented by `.`. The levels currently use spaces, which are undefined in the legend, causing the errors.

2. **Movement Rules:**
   Movement rules in PuzzleScript require proper syntax and commitment to specified movements. The rules in the code use a `>` symbol in an incorrect context and lack proper structure. These need correction to process movement actions properly.

For repaired code:

1. Replace the spaces in the level definitions with the defined `Background` character `.`.
2. Correct the movement rule syntax, ensuring movement acts directly on objects and maintains a consistent rule pattern.

Here is the corrected code:

### Key Changes:
- **Levels:** Replaced spaces with `.` to denote `Background`.
- **Rules:** Corrected the movement rules for directional player movement to refer directly to the `Player` objects and removed the incorrect `>` symbol. 

These changes resolve the console errors and should result in a fully functional game.
