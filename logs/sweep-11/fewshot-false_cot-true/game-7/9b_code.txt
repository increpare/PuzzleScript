Certainly! Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've reviewed and adjusted the levels to ensure each one is solvable.

Here are the changes to the levels:
- **Level 0**: Adjusted wall placement near the exit to make sure thereâ€™s a path from the player to the exit.
- **Level 1**: Added a path for the player to reach the exit.
- **Level 2**: Made sure there is a valid path for the player to navigate from the start to the exit.

This makes sure that each level is properly designed such that it can be completed. Test each level again to ensure their solvability.
