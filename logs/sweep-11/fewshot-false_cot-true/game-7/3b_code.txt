In the PuzzleScript code provided, the errors are related to the way colors are defined for objects. PuzzleScript typically defines objects with their identifying character and name, but the color specification provided here isn't adhering to the correct syntax. Additionally, the layers must be defined appropriately.

To fix these issues, I'll follow these steps:
1. Correct the color definitions, ensuring that colors are part of the objects' characteristics.
2. Make sure that the collision layers are specified correctly.
3. Ensure the win condition matches with the logic of the game.

Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code:

```plaintext
# Title and Author
title Sokoban Simple
author Game Designer

# Objects
=========
Background
yellow

Player
@ 
blue

Wall
# 
black

Box
B 
red

Target
O 
green

BoxOnTarget
G 
yellow

# Legend
=========
. = Background
@ = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
O = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

# Collision Layers
===================
Background
Player
Box, BoxOnTarget
Wall, Target

# Rules
===========
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]
[ BoxOnTarget | ] -> [ | Box ]

# Win Conditions
==================
All BoxOnTarget on Target

# Levels
=========
# Level 1
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######

# Level 2
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######
```

The key changes:
- Color properties were defined during object descriptions.
- The `# Legend` section maps characters to objects, which makes the level easier to interpret and ensures compatibility with PuzzleScript.
- Made sure the collision layers include all objects (fixed typo in collision layer definition).
- The rules now work with object representations that correspond with level layout (using Box, Target, BoxOnTarget correctly). 

This should address the compilation issues and allow the game to run as expected in PuzzleScript.
