The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code indicate issues with the object definitions, particularly regarding the use of ASCII art to define the appearance of the objects. In PuzzleScript, objects are defined more simply without detailed pixel art, unless using a specific tool that requires this. Furthermore, the script lacks a correct representation of the objects and possibly misuses the syntax for their colors. 

Here's a corrected version of the code that addresses the identified issues:

```

### Explanation
1. **Object Definitions**: I've simplified the object appearances to single characters, as PuzzleScript uses simple textual representations rather than detailed pixel art within the code. Each object is defined by a color followed by a character symbol.

2. **Visual Representation**: Since PuzzleScript is a text-based tool, it works with single characters for visual depiction rather than a block of pixel art.

3. **Overall Structure**: Retained the structure of the game, such as rules and levels, since they are properly defined. 

This revised version should no longer produce the compilation errors related to object definitions.
