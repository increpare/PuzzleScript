The errors in the original PuzzleScript code primarily revolve around the incorrect positioning of the `SOUNDS` section, incorrect sound token definitions, and improper logic for conditions in the rules. The compilation hints suggest:

1. The `SOUNDS` section is mispositioned and not being used correctly. In the corrected code, the `SOUNDS` section should typically define the sound effects used after declaring how they are referred to within the rules.
2. The placement of the `RULES` section should indeed follow the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section.
3. The logic for the winning state was wrongly connected: the rule stating "[ Player | Exit ] -> [ Player | Background ]" should be revised to define a condition that contributes to winning logically.
4. The current rules definition attempts to play sounds not correctly called in the sound section.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```

### Key Changes:
- `SOUNDS` is now placed after `COLLISIONLAYERS` and properly defined.
- Sound references have been correctly implemented in the `RULES` section using "SOUND Movement" after movement, ensuring that "move.ogg" and "win.ogg" ("Movement" and "Win") are used correctly.
- A logic-based win condition ensures gameplay recognizes when an exit is reached, shifting focus to when an Exit is removed (disappeared) as a win condition.
