When reviewing the console errors, it seems the primary issue is the ordering of sections and the incorrect handling of sounds within the "RULES" section. Let's address these in the following way:

1. The "COLLISIONLAYERS" section should come after the "LEGEND" section, but before the "SOUNDS" section. Currently, the sections are in the wrong order.

2. In the existing code, sounds are played using the keyword "SOUND" which seems incorrect or outdated for the current PuzzleScript version. We will modify this to use the correct sound referencing method as per documented guidelines.

3. Make sure sound filenames match exactly with what is provided in the game, ensuring case sensitivity, if applicable.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

Changes made:
- Ensured the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section was properly ordered before "SOUNDS".
- Corrected sound playing within the rules by using the correct format "M SOUND MOVE" and "M SOUND WIN".

This should address the given errors and allow the game to function correctly.
