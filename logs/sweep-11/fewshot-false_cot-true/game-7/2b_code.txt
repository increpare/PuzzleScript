The issues in the provided code relate to the fact that definitions of colors and symbols, which are part of the PuzzleScript prelude, aren't correctly formatted. The lines under "Objects" should contain the names and visuals of the objects, and below each object, its appearance in ASCII art format. Additionally, the legend definition should not repeat the objects and their characters since they are already defined as objects.

To fix these errors, let's clarify the correct format for the object declarations and remove repetitive legend definitions. We will assign colors directly within the object ASCII visualization. I will also ensure the "BoxOnTarget" object appears on the right collision layer by separating it from the Player and Box on a new line. Here's how the corrected code should look:

```plaintext
# Title and Author
title Sokoban Simple
author Game Designer

# Objects
=========
Background
...
yellow

Player
@ 
blue

Wall
#
black

Box
B
red

Target
O
green

BoxOnTarget
G
yellow

# Collision Layers
===================
Background
Player
Box, BoxOnTarget
Wall, Target

# Rules
===========
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]
[ BoxOnTarget | ] -> [ | Box ]

# Win Conditions
==================
All BoxOnTarget on Target

# Levels
=========
# Level 1
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######

# Level 2
#######
#..O..#
#..B..#
#..@..#
#######
```

Let's look at the changes:
- Object appearances now use immediate characters followed by their color definition inside the object section.
- Corrected the use of collision layers by separating BoxOnTarget.
- Eliminate duplication in the legend section, as it's unnecessary in the updated format.
- The overall structure and rules remain functional.
This should address the parser errors and set up the game correctly in PuzzleScript.
