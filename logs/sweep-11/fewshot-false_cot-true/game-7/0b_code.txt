To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I first need to consider the essential elements typically involved in constructing a PuzzleScript game. These elements include:

1. **Title and Author Information**: Basic metadata about the game.
2. **Objects**: Defining the sprites used in the game.
3. **Legend**: Mapping characters to objects for use in levels.
4. **Sound**: Optional sound settings.
5. **Collision Layers**: Defining the different layers of interaction.
6. **Rules**: Determining how objects interact or change state.
7. **Win Conditions**: Specifying how the player wins a level.
8. **Levels**: Designing the playable levels.

For this example, I'll create a simple Sokoban-style game where the player needs to push boxes onto target locations. I will include basic representations and straightforward rules to demonstrate PuzzleScript's capabilities.

Here's the complete code for a simple PuzzleScript game:

### Explanation
- **Title and Author**: Provides basic metadata for the game.
- **Objects**: Define the visual appearance and characteristics of game elements.
  - `Background`: The simple yellow floor.
  - `Player`: The character controlled by the user.
  - `Wall`: Impassable black barriers.
  - `Box`: Movable red boxes.
  - `Target`: Green locations where boxes need to be pushed.
  - `BoxOnTarget`: Represents a box correctly placed on a target.
- **Legend**: Maps simple characters to objects for easy level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Defines which objects can occupy the same space.
- **Rules**: Implement game mechanics, such as pushing boxes and transforming boxes when correctly placed.
- **Win Conditions**: Specify that all targets must have boxes for the player to win.
- **Levels**: Provides example layouts for gameplay.

This is a complete yet simple instance of a PuzzleScript game, suitable for demonstrating basic mechanics and interactions within the system.
