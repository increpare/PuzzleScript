To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the issues present in the `Objects` section, particularly around the definition of sprite properties. The console output indicates a misunderstanding of the syntax in the object definition, especially for defining colors in sprites.

The primary error messages indicate incorrect handling of colors and sprite matrices. In PuzzleScript, the syntax for color definitions and sprite matrices must be carefully adhered to.

In the original code:
- Line 5: There are issues with object definitions, especially the name "Colors" instead of "color".
- The syntax for defining colors and sprite contents does not match the expected format in PuzzleScript.

We'll correct these:
1. Use the correct syntax "color" (lowercase singular) instead of "Colors".
2. Correct the color definitions for each object.
3. Ensure the sprite matrix correctly starts immediately after the color definition, with no extra lines or comments.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation:
- Changed `Colors` to `color` to define the color palette correctly.
- Ensured that colors are defined in the correct order (primary, secondary) as used in the sprite matrix.
- Removed any inadvertent comments that got entangled with sprite matrix definitions.

With these changes, the syntax should align correctly with PuzzleScript expectations, resolving the errors and allowing the game to compile successfully.
