The provided error messages point towards issues primarily centered around the formatting and ordering of elements within the PuzzleScript object definitions and the legend section. Here’s a plan to address these issues:

1. **Color Definition and Sprite Issues**: The color definition needs to be placed correctly in the object section. The structure is `Object Name`, followed by the colors, then followed by the sprite representation. The error message suggests that the engine expects "color" to immediately follow the object name.

2. **Unknown Junk in Object Section**: This implies possible syntax errors where entries are not correctly formatted in line with expected syntax for object definitions.

3. **Legend Formatting Issue**: The legend is reporting a dangling "=" sign, which suggests that there's a misalignment either in the legend object implementation or a typo.

4. **Adjust the Order**: Ensure that all object definitions follow a consistent and correct order of defining names, colors, and sprite representations.

I will correct the errors by ensuring the object and legend sections are formatted properly according to PuzzleScript's specifications.

Here’s a corrected version of the code:
