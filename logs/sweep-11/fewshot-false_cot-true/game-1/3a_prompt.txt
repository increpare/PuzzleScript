=================================
line 5 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 7 : Was looking for color for object PLAYER, got "00000" instead.
line 8 : Trying to access color number 0 from the color palette of sprite PLAYER, but there are only 0 defined in it.
