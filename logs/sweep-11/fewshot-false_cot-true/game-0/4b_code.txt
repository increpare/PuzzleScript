The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code are primarily format-related, particularly with how object colors and glyphs are declared. Let's address these issues one by one:

1. **Attribute Ordering**: In PuzzleScript, the glyph for an object is typically defined after the color attribute. Currently, the glyph is defined before the color.

2. **Color Syntax**: The color syntax is correct, but the order of glyph and color attributes in the object definition needs correction.

3. **Name Reuse**: The error message “Name “0” already in use” indicates probably there's a conflict in objects or glyphs. In this context, it's likely referring to "color 0 0 0", interpreted wrongly due to ordering.

Having identified the issues, the plan is to:
- Correct the order of object attributes by placing `color` before the symbol.
- Re-evaluate and replace any problematic identifiers or attributes if necessary.

Let's repair the code:

I've re-ordered the attributes in object definitions so that the color comes first and the glyph or symbol comes after. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
