To correct the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to closely inspect each error message and adjust the script accordingly:

1. **Object Colors**: The error message indicates issues with the colors for the Background and Wall objects. The correct keyword is `Color`, not `color`.

2. **Wall Object Shape Definition**: The Wall object is expected to be a 5x5 grid definition based on the rest of the objects. The multiple "XXXXX" entries imply a misunderstanding of how shapes should be defined. Typically, each character in the shape grid represents a single cell of that object. If all five lines are the same with "XXXXX", only one line is necessary. However, since each object's representation should be unique, I'll assume we should adjust the pattern for it to fit the format.

3. **Duplicate Errors**: The "XXXXX" definition is listed multiple times. If the game uses a certain character to represent an object, it typically won't be duplicated five times, suggesting that a more detailed 5x5 shape might have been intended.

Let's correct these issues and offer a fixed code snippet:

In this version, the colors for the Background and Wall objects are adjusted by capitalizing "Color". The Wall object's representation is simplified. This should clear up the issues mentioned in the error messages.
