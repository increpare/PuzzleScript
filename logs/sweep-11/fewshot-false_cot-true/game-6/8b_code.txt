To address the errors and issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, I need to identify the following problems:

1. **Sprite Size Check:** Ensure that all object sprites are exactly 5x5 pixels. Each sprite should consist of exactly five lines, with each line containing five characters.
2. **Object Naming:** Object names should consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. I need to check and potentially revise object names to meet this requirement.
3. **Legend Formatting:** Confirm that the legend assigns single characters to object names and follows the correct format.
4. **Sound Events:** Clean up the improperly commented sound section and remove any faulty sound descriptions.
5. **General Syntax Errors:** Verify overall syntax in the rest of the file, ensuring segments like rules, collision layers, and levels conform to PuzzleScript syntax.

Let's go through these elements one by one to ensure everything matches the intended format.

### Summary of Changes:
- **Object Names:** Changed "BlockonGoal" to "Blockongoal" and "PlayeronGoal" to "Playerongoal" to satisfy lowercase naming.
- **Legend Assignment:** Updated the corresponding names to match the object definitions and to maintain consistency.
- **Sounds Section:** Removed improper sound comments, ensuring unreferenced blocks are clear.
- **General Syntax Check:** Checked each section for adherence to PuzzleScript standards.
