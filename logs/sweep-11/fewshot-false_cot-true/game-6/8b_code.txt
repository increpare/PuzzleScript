To address the errors, let's carefully examine the game code and correct any syntax issues or inconsistencies:

1. **Color Declarations:** Ensure proper color references following the `color` keyword for each object.
   
2. **Sprite Matrices:** Check for correct use of sprite matrix dimensions and `X` positions in relation to other parts of the game code.

3. **Error Messages:** Focus on understanding the nature of the errors reported, specifically addressing color definitions and sprite structure.

Here is the revised code with the identified issues corrected:

### Explanation:

- **Color Declaration Errors**: In the original error messages, "got 'color ' instead" suggests a misuse of the color keyword. Make sure `color` is correctly specified for `Background`, `Wall`, and others without spaces or errors before the actual color code.
  
- **Sprite Matrix for Wall**: Ensure that wall sprite matrix was correctly using the slot with labeled blocks often filled with `X`s for full wall coverage.

By addressing these specific issues, we should have successfully resolved the compilation errors and created a functional game description.
