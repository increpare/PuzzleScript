To address the issues listed in the console output, we must perform the following steps:

1. **Objects Section Error**: The error message suggests issues with the format of the objects. In PuzzleScript, each object should consist of a name and a 5x5 pixel sprite pattern represented by a character grid. The `OBJECTS` section must contain the sprites. Fix the format by defining a 5x5 sprite for each object.

2. **Legend Section Error**: The LEGEND section uses symbols to define shortcuts for the objects. Ensure each entry follows the correct format `A = B`.

3. **Missing Sounds Section**: The `SOUNDS` section is missing. Although you don't need to have sounds defined, the heading should be present.

4. **Levels Section Error**: The LEVEL section seems to be encountering issues, possibly due to misalignment or misformatting of the symbols.


Let's address these issues by correcting the game code:

Changes made:

- Added 5x5 pixel grid representations for each object in the `OBJECTS` section.
- Maintain empty definition for the `SOUNDS` section for correct ordering in PuzzleScript.
- Corrected slight symbols in the `LEVELS` section to ensure everything aligns and uses appropriate symbols.
