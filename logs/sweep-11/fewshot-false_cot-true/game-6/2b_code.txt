To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to carefully analyze the issues and make appropriate corrections. Here's a breakdown of the errors and the necessary fixes:

1. **Color Definition Errors for Objects:**  
   The console output mentioned that the "WWWWW" object was defined multiple times, which suggests an issue with the definition of the `Wall` object's color pattern. PuzzleScript requires the object name to match the color definitions, and this is case-sensitive. Also, there seems to be confusion regarding color blocks representation.

2. **Junk in Spritematrix for `Player`:**  
   The `Player` object sprite matrix has unknown junk. Make sure the sprite matrix contains only valid sprite lines with corresponding characters as defined in the legend.

3. **Sprite Sizes:** 
   It looks like the sprite dimensions (5x5) don't match the expected representation. Each sprite should align with the overall style and consistency of the design.

4. **Object Usage in Collision Layers:** 
   Ensure that the collision layers are correctly defined and aligned with the object naming in the legend.

I'll correct the object sprite matrices to match the expected 5x5 pattern by ensuring consistent sizing and alignment with correct game object naming. Here's the fixed code:

Summary of Fixes:
- The `Wall` object's sprite representation matches its intended use with consistent naming and color representation without duplication.
- Ensured all objects have consistent 5x5 sprite sizes and adjusted sprites and colors where necessary.
- Resolved previously mentioned errors related to the player object's sprite matrix.
