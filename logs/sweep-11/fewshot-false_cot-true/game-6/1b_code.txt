To address the issues with the provided PuzzleScript code, let's analyze the errors step by step and clarify the sections that require correction:

1. **Unknown Junk in Object Section (Lines 32 and 34):**  
   The error suggests issues in the OBJECTS section. In PuzzleScript, object definitions should be concise and only contain the object's name followed by a color or ASCII pattern. Ensure object names contain valid characters (a-z0-9).

2. **Legend Errors (Lines 44, 46):**  
   Legends need to map symbols to object names correctly. Check for syntax errors like formatting legends properly (e.g., ". = Background").

3. **Unexpected Sound Token (Lines 48, 49):**
   Sound section in PuzzleScript does not support `1 fx 100 0.1` format directly as used here. Currently, PuzzleScript does not formally support sound; this might be a speculative or placeholder feature. Remove the SOUNDS section for the time being since it’s not standard.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Changes:
- **Sound Section Removed:** Since it's not standard in PuzzleScript, it has been stripped out to prevent errors.
- **Rules Update:** Ensured the push behavior is expressed in a typical manner using collisions.
- **Valid Object Definitions:** Confirmed that object names and definitions adhere to the PuzzleScript format.

By correcting these issues, the script should compile without errors and behave as expected for a Sokoban-like block-pushing game.
