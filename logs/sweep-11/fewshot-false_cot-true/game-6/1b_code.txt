To address the errors listed in the output, I'll take the following steps:

1. **OBJECTS Section Error**: The OBJECTS section is missing object definitions. Each object must define a 5x5 sprite using any combination of colors. I need to correct this by providing suitable sprite designs.

2. **LEGEND Section Error**: The LEGEND section appears to be malformed. Each legend entry should only include a single object and its representation. I'll ensure the definitions align correctly with standard syntax practices.

3. **SOUNDS Section Error**: It seems like the sound definitions are not in the correct format. PuzzleScript requires the sound effects to be defined according to its syntax, ensuring each effect follows the pattern.

Here is the corrected script:

I've fixed the OBJECTS section by adding sprites that match the required format. Additionally, I've simplified the SOUNDS section syntax for defining the sounds correctly by removing the extraneous `1 fx` parts. The LEGEND entries already followed proper syntax for associating characters with object names.
