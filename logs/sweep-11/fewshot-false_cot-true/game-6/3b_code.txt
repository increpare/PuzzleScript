To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, I will follow these steps:

1. **Fix Object Colors:** Ensure that all objects have correct color names. The error suggests that line 22 is expecting a color name but receives "wwwww," indicating that the color name might be incorrect.

2. **Correct Object Definitions:** Objects must not have the same name repeatedly defined in their sprite matrix. The error suggests that the Wall object has repeated lines. Additionally, the Player object contains an incorrect character 'p' that is not within the scope of the defined sprite matrix characters ('.', 'w', etc.).

3. **Correct the Sprite Matrix:** Ensure all sprite matrices are 5x5 and correctly defined, using consistent symbols.

4. **Collision Layers and Rules:** Ensure they are correctly defined, although the main errors identified are in the object sprites.

Let's correct the code now:

**Explanation:**
1. The color definition issue was due to misunderstanding the sprite matrix for Wall. Corrected it to use uppercase 'W' for Wall.
   
2. The Player object's previously undefined character 'p' in the sprite matrix was replaced with '@', maintaining consistency with the symbol definitions.

3. All sprite matrices are unchanged concerning dimensions, maintaining a 5x5 format, with revised characters where necessary.

This should compile without the reported errors and function as originally intended.
