The errors in the console output indicate there are issues with the sprite matrix definitions for certain objects, specifically using an unexpected character. PuzzleScript's sprite matrices use a set of characters (e.g., `0-9`, `a-z`, `A-Z`, `!@#$`, etc.) to represent pixels in a 5x5 grid, where a non-space character represents a filled pixel. The use of 'W' and '@' in `Wall`, `Player`, `Block`, and other objects' sprite definitions is causing the issue because `W` and `@` are not valid sprite characters. 

To fix the issue, I'll replace these characters with valid sprite characters. I'll use `0` for filled pixels, which is a common practice for simplicity in the PuzzleScript language. I'll revise the sprite definitions for all the objects involved to make sure they match the appropriate conventions. Then I'll return the repaired code.

I've replaced 'W' and '@' with '0', which is a valid character in a sprite matrix for representing filled pixels. This should address the compilation errors related to the sprite definitions.
