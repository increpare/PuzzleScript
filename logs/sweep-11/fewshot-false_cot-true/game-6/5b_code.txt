The console output indicates issues with color definitions and sprite matrix errors. These issues need to be addressed one by one:

1. **Color Definition Issue** - The errors on lines 12, 20, and 28 suggest there's an issue with the color definitions for the objects Background, Wall, and Player. In PuzzleScript, the syntax requires a newline after the `color` declaration and before the sprite matrix begins. If this isn't followed correctly, it can result in parsing issues. 
  
2. **Sprite Matrix Errors** - The sprite matrix issue for the Wall object (lines 22 to 24). These errors indicate problems within the Wall object's sprite matrix, which might not be well-formatted or contain unwanted characters.

3. **Overall Plan** - Review the object definitions for errors in their syntax, such as missing whitespace or invalid characters, and fix accordingly. Ensure each color declaration is properly formatted with a newline separation from the sprite matrix definitions.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

### Changes Made:
1. Added a newline after the `color` statement in each object definition.
2. Corrected the Wall object sprite matrix to ensure it matches the typical size expected by PuzzleScript (5x5 sprite matrix). I used `XXXXX` for the Wall to make sure it is consistent and correct. 

These changes align with the expected formatting in PuzzleScript and should resolve the errors reported during compilation.
