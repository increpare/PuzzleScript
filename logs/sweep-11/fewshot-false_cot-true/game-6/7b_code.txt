The provided code is generating errors due to several issues within the PuzzleScript format. Let's address these errors one by one:

1. **Object Dimensions:** PuzzleScript requires all sprites for objects to be exactly 5 pixels wide and high. This is already handled properly in the script, so there is no issue with the dimensions.

2. **Legend Issues:** The errors in the console output suggest problems with the Legend section, particularly around misuse or misplacement of rules, which should not be in the Legend section.

3. **Sounds Section:** There are some commented-out lines in the Sounds section, but these are not causing the compilation errors given they are commented out.

4. **Rule/Writing Errors:** The compiler is having issues with the Legend and Object sections due to syntax errors related to special characters or even line breaks. We should ensure the Legend section follows the proper syntax.

5. **Redundant/Incorrect Lines:** There are no syntax issues evident in the `WinCondition` section provided, but ensure it is correctly formatted in the game code.

6. **Misplaced or Extra Lines:** Review of misplacements or extra lines, particularly around the Legend and Sound sections, may resolve some unexpected character errors.

Here's the revised code with the reasoning applied:

### Summary of Changes:
- **Legend Fixes:** Fixed any potential issues by re-ordering and confirming correct associations of characters and objects.
- **Sound Section:** Ensured that comments in the Sounds section were clearly marked with the correct comment prefix to avoid misinterpretation.
- **Other Cleanup:** Reviewed the entire code for syntax compliance and inline comments to ensure clarity.

These changes should help compile the game without errors while keeping the game structure and logic intact.
