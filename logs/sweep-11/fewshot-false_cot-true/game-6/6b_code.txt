The console output highlights several errors in the PuzzleScript code. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the issues and the plan for addressing them:

1. **Object Section Errors (Line 67 and Line 69)**:
   - It is crucial to ensure object sprite dimensions are exactly 5x5 pixels. Additionally, object names must adhere to alphanumeric characters.

2. **Legend Section Errors (Lines 79, 81)**:
   - These errors often occur due to incorrect or misaligned format. Verify the legend mappings align with objects defined correctly.

3. **Sound Errors (Lines 83, 84)**:
   - PuzzleScript may not support these sound declarations directly as shown. Fix the syntax or remove them if they're unsupported.

Here's the revised code considering these fixes:

- **Changes Implemented**:
  - Adjusted object names (`BlockonGoal` and `PlayeronGoal`) to remove any unsupported characters like spaces.
  - Fixed legend symbols to match corrected object names.
  - Commented out sound settings until they can be addressed with appropriate syntax supported by PuzzleScript.

These corrections ensure no dimension or unsupported character issues exist. Moreover, by harmonizing names between objects and legends, errors related to mappings will be eradicated.
