Let's start by analyzing the current issues in the code:
1. The first error indicates a problem with the `Background` object's color definition. The line received a `color ` keyword but perhaps without the correct value.
2. The second error suggests a similar issue with the `Wall` object's color definition.
3. The line indicated for errors refers to the object pattern rather than the color, suggesting misalignment in pattern formatting or an issue with too many identical objects.
4. Several lines indicate that the same pattern `XXXXX` is defined multiple times, which typically indicates either an incorrect pattern or a formatting error.

Here are the steps needed to correct the code:
- Check and correct the color definitions of each object to ensure they have the correct #RRGGBB format.
- Ensure each object has a unique pattern that matches its intended display.
- Simplify and adjust the patterns to prevent duplication (e.g., removing excessive overlapping or identical patterns).
- Validate that the objects are properly defined and distinct in the pattern.

Let's repair the code:

This repaired version of the code should correct the compilation errors by ensuring the correct color definitions and patterns for the objects.
