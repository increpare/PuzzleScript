To address the errors and issues reported in the PuzzleScript game code, let's analyze the problems and determine the appropriate corrections:

1. **Color Definition Errors**: The error messages indicate issues with the color attribute for objects like `Background` and `Wall`. The errors suggest that the syntax for defining colors is being incorrectly interpreted.

2. **Object Pattern Definition**: The messages about "XXXXX" suggest there's an issue related to the representation or repetition of characters in the object patterns. Patterns should be 5x5 in size, and it seems there might be confusion or redundancy in how these are represented. 

3. **Duplicate Object Definitions**: The errors about repeatedly defining "XXXXX" suggest that the object representation pattern is either not needed or incorrectly defined multiple times.

Given this analysis, the plan of action is:

- Ensure the color syntax uses a valid format.
- Ensure that object patterns are distinct and correctly match the 5x5 pattern format.
- Correct any redundant or overlapping pattern definitions.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

### Key Corrections

- **Wall Object**: Adjust the pattern and avoid overly repetitive definitions.
- Each object definition now follows the prescribed 5x5 format appropriately, ensuring clarity in the visual representation of game elements. 
- I made sure each visual definition represents its intended object without redundancy.
