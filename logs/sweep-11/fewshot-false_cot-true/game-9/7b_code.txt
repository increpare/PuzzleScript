To address the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript code, let's analyze the structure and identify the problem areas. The console output shines light on a few issues primarily related to comments within the `RULES` section. In PuzzleScript, everything outside of the brackets in the `RULES` section, except for recognized commands, is interpreted as directions or commands. Therefore, comments written like plain text will trigger errors unless they are properly formatted.

The errors are triggered by lines interpreted as parts of rule definitions when they are meant to be comments. In PuzzleScript, comments are typically prefaced by a `#` at the start of the line. 

Let's make sure the comments are properly formatted with `#` and remove any unnecessary text, which is causing parsing issues:

In this revised version of the script:
- I placed comment markers `#` correctly at the start of the comment lines within the `RULES` section to clarify they are comments.
- I retained the overall structure and essentials of the game as per your original intent.

This should compile without errors and function correctly as a Sokoban clone.
