To repair the code, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Remove the incorrect syntax in the prelude**: 
   The initial lines with comments explaining the legend should be removed, as PuzzleScript does not support comments in that format. This will address the `Unrecognised stuff in the prelude` error.
   
2. **Ensure unique object characters**:
   Remove duplicate definitions of objects in the LEGEND section. Specifically, it's important to ensure that each character in the legend maps to a unique object. The `B` character is being used two times (`Box` and `BoxOnTarget`), which causes conflicts. This can be resolved by using a different character for `BoxOnTarget`.

3. **Redefine rules and win conditions accordingly**:
   The rules must align with the objects and characters from the legend. Ensure that the rules correctly reference the updated legend.

Here is the amended code:

Adjustments were made to ensure unique representation of each object within the game and the legend. This should resolve compilation issues and ensure the game adheres to PuzzleScript standards.
