To address the compilation errors, let's break down the issues systematically:

1. **Unrecognised stuff in the prelude (Line 5):** The error suggests an issue before the 'OBJECTS' section. In the provided code, there's an extra '======' line between metadata and the 'OBJECTS' section. This should be removed, as it's not needed.

2. **Duplicate aliases in the 'LEGEND' section (Lines 38-41):** Aliases like `P`, `B`, `T`, and `o` are already defined in the 'OBJECTS' section and should not be redefined. We should remove the redefinitions from the 'LEGEND' section.

3. **Objects outside of square brackets (Line 63):** There is a rule involving objects without using the correct bracket notation. In PuzzleScript, the rule should only involve objects within square brackets. This error could be present in the rules defining movement onto Targets, where it's attempting to define a transformation but is incorrectly written.

Let's revise the code accordingly:

Here's what I've done:

- Removed the extra '======' line between metadata and game section.
- Removed redundant entries from the 'LEGEND' section for `P`, `B`, `T`, and `o` which were previously defined in 'OBJECTS'.
- Corrected the transformation rule for moving the player onto a target by ensuring it respects PuzzleScript syntax for objects in transformations.

This should address the compilation errors and fix the game logic.
