The error in the original code occurred because each object must reference the correct amount of colors that were defined for that object. Errors were found due to attempts to access colors in the wall and paint bucket graphics, but the colors were not defined correctly for them. I adjusted the color references to just have a single color reference which matches those objects' single color.
