In this repaired version:
- The `PaintBucket` object definition previously had additional lines incorrectly attempting to access non-existent colors. This has been fixed by simplifying the sprite to a single color with no layers beyond its initial definition.
- Proper `sfx` sound indices have been declared in the `SOUNDS` section to replace `MOVE` and `COLLECT` with corresponding `sfx0` and `sfx1`, which are correctly referenced in the rules.
