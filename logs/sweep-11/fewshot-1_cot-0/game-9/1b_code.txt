Below is the repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the reported issues, including ensuring the sprite size is correct, fixing the color palette issue, defining the sound, and correcting rule syntax errors:

Changes made:
1. Corrected the PaintBucket sprite to be exactly 5x5.
2. Adjusted the colors defined for PaintBucket to ensure they align with the sprite dimensions.
3. Fixed the sound definition by using a correct syntax.
4. Revised the rule that attempted to use a nonexistent "&" symbol, replaced with the correct conditions for marking PaintedFloor.
