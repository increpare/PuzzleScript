To make the level solvable, you should ensure there is a direct path from the player to the exit 'E' without obstructions like walls 'T'. Let's adjust the level layout:

In this revised level layout, I've ensured there's an accessible path from the player 'P' to the exit 'E'. The player can navigate around the traps without being obstructed by walls or getting blocked in.
