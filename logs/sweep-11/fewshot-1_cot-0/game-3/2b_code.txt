Certainly! The errors mentioned in the console output indicate that certain objects in the game are trying to access colors that have not been properly defined. To fix these errors, we need to make sure that each object has the correct number of colors defined.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

In this version, each object has the correct number of colors defined. Each character in the object's pixel map corresponds to a color number, starting from 0, and each object must have the necessary colors specified at the top of its section. If more than one color is required, they should be listed before the pixel map of each entity. In this case, the wall was correctly defined with a single color (darkgrey), and the player is corrected by having only the green color it needs for its depiction.
