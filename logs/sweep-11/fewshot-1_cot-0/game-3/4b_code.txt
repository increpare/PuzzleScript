**Explanation of Fixes:**

1. **Target Object:**
   - Updated the color matrix from misfiring with undefined color indices to a valid palette using `.`, `0`, lists to define the shape.

2. **Crate Object:**
   - Fixed errors with accessing undefined color indices by providing a proper palette with `.`, `0`. The crate now has a border defined by `1` which was changed to `0`.

3. **Background Object:**
   - Added missing data for the Background object.

These fixes should resolve the errors highlighted in the compiler output and provide a working PuzzleScript game.
