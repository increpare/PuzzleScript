**Explanation of Changes:**

1. In the `Target` object definition, the stray `lightyellow` color name is removed and replaced with the actual `#FFFF00` color value. The hex color code #FFFF00 (yellow) was previously specified on line 34 but `lightyellow` (line 33) was incorrectly specified and removed.
   
2. Error messages commented on object "target" not having color specified, the modification ensures the correct color is assigned to the target object.
