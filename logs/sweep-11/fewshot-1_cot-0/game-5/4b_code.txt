In this repaired version of the code, I have corrected color accesses for the `RedTarget`, `YellowTarget`, and potentially similar targets by ensuring their palettes have the correct number of colors defined or used. Each target's design uses one color rather than multiple, so I've amended their color declarations in a way that would avoid incorrect access errors. If needed, verify each sprite uses the correct number of colors for what's been defined and accessed.
