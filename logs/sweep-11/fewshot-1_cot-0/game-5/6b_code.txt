In this repaired code, I corrected the sound token errors by using the correct capitalization for sound identifiers and by using `endgame` instead of `win`. Additionally, I resolved the layer errors by adding the target objects (RedTarget, YellowTarget, and BlueTarget) to the COLLISIONLAYERS section.
