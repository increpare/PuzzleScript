The errors you're seeing are because the sprite definitions for `RedTarget`, `YellowTarget`, and `BlueTarget` attempt to access colors that are not defined for those sprites. The error messages indicate that there's only one color defined in their palette lines (e.g., `#FF8888` for `RedTarget`), but the sprite patterns attempt to use multiple color levels.

To fix these errors, we need to define those target objects correctly by adjusting their patterns and using only the background color since these targets don't require different shades or patterns similar to blocks. Let's make those corrections:

I've changed the pattern of `RedTarget`, `YellowTarget`, and `BlueTarget` to no longer use undefined levels of shading. Now, each target is simply a block filled with a single color. This should compile without errors.
