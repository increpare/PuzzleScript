### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Wall Object Definition:** In the `Wall` object, the sprite data has been reduced to a one-line definition (`11111`) because only one color is defined for this object. This addresses the console errors about trying to access more colors than are present.

2. **Sound Name:** The sound `movePlayer` in the `SOUNDS` section was changed to `playerMove` to match the usage in the rules section which utilizes `playerMove` instead. This addresses the unexpected sound token error.

3. **Consistency in Sound Usage:** Consistency has been ensured in the rules section by using `playerMove` instead of `movePlayer`.

These corrections should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
