Notes:
- Changed "TELEPORT" and "REACHGOAL" under SOUNDS to "MOVE" and "CANTMOVE" as these are the expected sound verbs in PuzzleScript. Custom sound verbs need to be predefined.
- Removed the sound verbs from the problematic RULES as these directly reference the actions without custom sound verbs.
- Verified syntactical correctness for expected PuzzleScript rules and functionality.
