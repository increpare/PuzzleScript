### Key Fixes:
1. **Sound Definitions**: Correct sound definitions syntax to match the PuzzleScript requirements by updating them to include action names (e.g., `Player MOVE`).
2. **Sprites Size**: All sprite graphics should be 5x5; ensured the goal sprite matches this requirement.
3. **Rule Syntax**: Ensured each rule has matching patterns on both sides.
4. **Rectangular Levels**: Made sure all levels are rectangular with consistent row lengths.
5. **CollisionLayers Order**: The layers were adjusted to ensure the proper functioning of portals and player interactions. 

With these corrections, your game should work as intended.
