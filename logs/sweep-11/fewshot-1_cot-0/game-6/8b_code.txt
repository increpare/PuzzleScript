The issue in your code stems from the use of the `#` character in the levels section, which is not defined in the legend. To fix this, you need to define `#` as a Wall (or any other object you prefer that will serve as a boundary). Here's the repaired version of the code:

In this version, I added the `Wall` object and updated the levels to include the new legend definition for `#`. This should resolve the compilation errors.
