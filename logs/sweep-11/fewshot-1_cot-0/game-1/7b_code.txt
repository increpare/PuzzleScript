The errors were caused by unrecognized color names "lightyellow" and "lightorange" in the object declarations for Block3 and Block4. The correct format for color specification in PuzzleScript is a single color name without a prefix "light". Adjust the colors to use recognizable colors that fit within the expected palette.
