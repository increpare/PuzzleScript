To fix the errors in your PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that each object sprite has the correct number of colors defined in its color palette. The errors indicated that the sprites had more colors defined in the sprites themselves than available in their respective color palettes. Here's the corrected game code:

Changes made:
- Each object now includes a second color in the color palette as indicated in the sprite definition after the primary color. This is necessary for the multi-layer pixels in the sprite graphics. For `Player`, `Block1`, `Block2`, `Block3`, `Block4`, and `Target`, I've added secondary lighter colors. Adjust the colors to your preference if needed.
