**Changes made:**
- Adjusted the sprite definition for `Wall` by replacing `11111` with `.....` to match PlayScript's requirements of using `.` for transparency. This avoids errors accessing undefined color indices.
- No changes were required for the `Player` object as it correctly uses two colors, `#FFD700` and `#FF8C00`. The initial colors list was correct for two colors.
- Ensured that all object definitions have the appropriate number of colors as each pattern uses in their visual representation (e.g., ensuring a pattern of "11111" has a matching number of defined colors if necessary). However, the actual pattern definition within the `Wall` was primarily responsible for the initial error.
