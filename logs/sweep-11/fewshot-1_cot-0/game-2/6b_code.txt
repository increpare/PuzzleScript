**Corrections Made:**

1. **Color Index for `PortalExit`:** The sprite had an attempt to access an undefined color index. I corrected the sprite pattern to properly use the two defined colors, similar to `PortalEntrance`.
2. **Sound Definitions:** The sound seeds were incorrectly placed. I defined them correctly under the `SOUNDS` section with the keys `SFX1` and `SFX2` followed directly by their respective seeds.
