The error might have been caused because, in this particular configuration and ruleset, there was no way for the `Player` to interact correctly with the `Goal` due to a mismatch in rule application or initial player placement. Adjusting the starting positions or ensuring that reaching the goal is actually possible should resolve this. Please ensure the initial configuration allows the player to interact with all goals needed to satisfy the win condition.
