Here's a corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code that addresses the errors in your script:

### Key Fixes:
1. **Goal Object Colors**: Reduced to one line of pixels, as its original state was attempting to use more colors than defined.
2. **Order of Sections**: Added an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section since every section is required even if empty.
3. **Rules Section**: Corrected the "WINCONDITIONS" to reference the existing objects by ensuring Player is on Goal (the original statement was `All Goals on Player`, which was incorrect for the win condition logic).
