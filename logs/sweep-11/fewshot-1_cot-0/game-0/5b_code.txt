It appears that Level 0 is not solvable because the Player cannot reach any Goal to change it into a Target. To solve this issue, you might consider restructuring the level layout to allow the player to interact with the Goals. Here's a suggestion:

```plaintext
#######
#..G..#
#..P..#
#..G..#
#..G..#
#######
```

In this layout, the Player is now adjacent to a Goal, allowing for interaction and conversion into a Target, making the level solvable according to the given rules and win conditions.
