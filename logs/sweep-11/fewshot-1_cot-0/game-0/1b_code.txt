### Changes Made:

1. **Corrected Goal Object's Color Indexing**: Fixed the Goal object's sprite pattern that incorrectly referenced color indices beyond its single defined color. Ensure it uses only one color with no visual pattern.
   
2. **Corrected Sound Token Usage**: Changed the incorrect `ColorChange` keyword to lowercase `sfx1` in the rules section; PuzzleScript uses `sfx` keywords to refer to sound effects.
   
3. **Added Legend for `#`**: Defined `#` in the Legend section to refer to Walls, which were previously unspecified despite being used in the level layout.

This corrected code should compile without errors and work as intended.
