Here is the repaired version of the PuzzleScript game code. I've focused on correcting the syntax in the rules section to properly handle object manipulation:

message Collect the light, move the mirrors, and transport through portals!

This version resolves the syntax issues by making sure all objects are correctly referenced within rules using the correct bracket notation. The rules are now set up to allow player interaction with mirrors as well as the teleportation mechanic via portals.
