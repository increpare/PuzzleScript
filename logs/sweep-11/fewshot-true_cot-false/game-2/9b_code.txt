Certainly! The errors in the game code are due to incorrect comments in the rules section, where it mistakenly treats comments as actual code. PuzzleScript uses the `#` symbol to begin a comment, but comments should not include words or objects that can be interpreted as part of a rule. To fix this, comment lines should be properly formatted to avoid unexpected errors. Here's the corrected version of your game code:

The main issues were the comments being treated as potential syntax. The comments now start with `#` but don't incorrectly describe game elements within them.
