### Changes Made:
- **Player Object**: Added additional colors to the palette to ensure consistency with the sprite pattern usage.
- **Mirror Object**: Added additional colors to the palette to ensure consistency with the sprite pattern usage.

These fixes ensure that each color index used in the 5x5 sprite patterns is accounted for in the color definitions.
