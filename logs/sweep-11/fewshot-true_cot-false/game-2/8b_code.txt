Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I have refined the rules and syntax based on the error messages:

Changes made:
- Corrected the usage of objects outside of square brackets in rules.
- Fixed syntax for the Player pushing Mirror rule to ensure mirrors aren't pushed into walls.
- Adjusted the portal travel rule to remove objects outside of brackets and corrected their sequence.
- Verified sound effects are placed in appropriate rule positions.
