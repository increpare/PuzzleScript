### Changes Made:
1. Updated the Wall object's color definition to have two colors by adding an additional `#555555` to match the structure (since only one color was initially provided leading to access errors).
2. Corrected the sound command in the rule for moving crates from `crateMove` to `MOVE` to adhere to the specified soundverb requirements.
