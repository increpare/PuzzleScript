### Changes Made
1. In the `SOUNDS` section, updated:
   - `"Player REACHED"` instead of `"Goal REACH"`, as the status change of the player (on reaching a goal) usually triggers the sound.
2. Fixed naming issues in the `RULES` section matching the corrected sound effects.
3. Added `Player` collision sound effects in the `WARP` rule.
