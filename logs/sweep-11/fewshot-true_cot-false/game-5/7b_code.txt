### Fixes Implemented:
1. **Sound Token Correction**: Changed sound event names from `player` and `block` to `playerMove` and `blockMove`, as sound names can't be directly `player` or `block` due to keyword conflict.
2. **Token Name Fix**: Used `playerMove` instead of the keyword `PLAYER` in the RULES section.
3. **Ensured Consistency**: Ensured that naming conventions are consistent across sound definitions and their subsequent usage in the rules.
