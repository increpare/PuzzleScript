Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. In PuzzleScript, sound tokens such as `player_move`, `block_move`, `end_level`, and `end_game` aren't inherently recognized as specific by the language. Instead, you should use the predefined sound keywords like `sfx0`, `sfx1`, etc. The sounds are then referred to by these identifiers in the rules.
