Here is the corrected version of the code. The errors in the color definitions for `Block2`, `Block3`, and `Block4` have been addressed by ensuring the right number of colors are defined for each object.

Changes made:
- For `Block2`, `Block3`, and `Block4`, I added another color to match up with the usage in the pattern below, ensuring that the color indices in the object sprite definition have corresponding colors. 
- The colors for each block are now correctly specified to meet the usage in the sprite definitions.
