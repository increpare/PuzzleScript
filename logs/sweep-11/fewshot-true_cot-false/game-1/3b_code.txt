Note: The error messages suggest that the color definitions for `Block3` and `Block4` may have extraneous spaces or incorrect formatting. After carefully reviewing the objects section, the color blocks are correctly defined with three colors each, and no additional spaces exist in color names. If there are still issues, reevaluate the color palette and ensure it strictly adheres to PuzzleScript syntax.
