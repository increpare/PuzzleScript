### Changes Made:
- Corrected the sprite pattern for `Planet` and `Player`. They both were using `..11` which accessed a color index `1` that didn't exist.
- Changed `..11` to `.111` for both `Planet` and `Player` object definitions. This pattern uses a color index `1` as required by the sprite definition, which is consistent with the indices being defined.
- Ensured that all sprites have consistent use of colors based on their index and pattern definitions.
