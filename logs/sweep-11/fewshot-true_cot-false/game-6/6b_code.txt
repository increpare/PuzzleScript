The errors are happening because of incorrect color specifications in the `Planet`, `Player`, and `PlanetCollectedText` sprites. Each color code in the `color reserved slots` for a sprite should match the indices used in the color pattern of the sprite.

Here's the corrected code:

Changes:
- The indices used in the `Planet`, `Player`, and `PlanetCollectedText` sprites were corrected to make sure the sprites use the appropriate color palette. Specifically, changed indices from 1 to 0 to match the single color defined for these sprites.
