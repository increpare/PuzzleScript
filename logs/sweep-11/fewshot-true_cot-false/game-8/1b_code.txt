Here is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. I've fixed errors related to the color palette for `Player` and `Treasure` objects, along with a valid color name for `Treasure`.

In this fixed version:
- The `Player` object was given a second color to ensure proper index access.
- The `Treasure` object now has the color `yellow` along with a secondary color `pink` to ensure it shares a consistent format. This is a more typical color available in most systems.
- Ensured consistent format and punctuation.
