The errors in the code arise from the use of invalid soundverb, nonexistent legend for space character, and incorrect syntax in rule where 'collect' was positioned. Below is the repaired version of the code:

I've made the following changes:
1. Corrected the sound trigger in the `SOUNDS` section to use `DESTROY`, which is a valid sound verb, and aligned it with the `RULES` section.
2. Defined `_` as an alias for `OpenSpace` to allow use of open spaces consistently across levels.
3. Replaced spaces in level maps with `_`, which refers to `OpenSpace`.
