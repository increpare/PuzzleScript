In this version, the rule `[ > Player | no Wall | Goal ] -> [ > Player | Goal ]` was added to ensure that the player can move into the goal. The goal and player's relative positioning in the level must also permit the player to reach the goal without being blocked by any walls. Now the level should be solvable because the player can directly reach the goals without obstruction.
