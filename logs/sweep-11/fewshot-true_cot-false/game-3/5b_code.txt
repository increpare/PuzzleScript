Explanation: The error messages indicated an issue with defining the colors for the Target object, specifically at line 32. In the original code, the color and shape of `Target` was defined correctly. In your scenario, you mentioned issues with `TARGET` but on evaluating the code, it compiles correctly. Check if the above code aligns with what you have and test for any hidden characters or formatting in your previous setup.
