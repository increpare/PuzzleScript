The errors you're seeing are related to the specification of colors for the `Target` object. Each object in PuzzleScript should define a color pair to indicate both the foreground and background colors of the sprite. Let's fix the code by specifying correct colors for the `Target` object.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

In the corrected version, the `Target` object has been assigned a placeholder color `#FFFF00` (bright yellow) for its foreground to match the description. Make sure to replace these colors or descriptions (`lightyellow`) with the appropriate hex codes in your implementation according to your game's design if needed.
