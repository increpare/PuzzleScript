Certainly! The errors in your code are mainly due to the incorrect use of comments and the lack of sprite definitions for the objects. In PuzzleScript, comments are not officially supported using the '//' syntax. Instead, any comments should be added through the usage of an empty OBJECT or LEGEND section when needed, just for organization purposes. Additionally, every object needs a 5x5 sprite. Below is a corrected version of your game code:

In this corrected version, each object has a 5x5 sprite defined with '.....', and the comment sections have been removed or treated. The rule and win conditions should now operate correctly without any unsupported comment syntax causing errors.
