Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The error on line 75 has been fixed by ensuring the rule has equal-length patterns on the left and right sides:

The rule `[ Player | Exit ] -> [ Player | Exit ] message Game completed!` now correctly matches the left and right sides by keeping both patterns of equal length, including `Exit` on the right side to maintain consistency in pattern length.
