The errors in the PuzzleScript code you provided were due to the shape matrix for the "Wall" object not being valid (it should be a 5 by 5 grid made up of 0s and other allowed characters), a misplaced sound command within a rule, and a mismatch in the rule pattern matching. Here is a corrected version of the code addressing these issues:

Changes made:
1. Adjusted the sprite matrix for the "Wall" object to be a valid 5x5 matrix.
2. Moved the sound command `SFX0` outside and after the rule to execute it correctly.
3. Verified that the number of matches on each side of the rule arrow is equal, maintaining consistent rule patterns.
