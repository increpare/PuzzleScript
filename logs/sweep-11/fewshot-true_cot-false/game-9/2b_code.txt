### Changes made:
1. **Wall Object**: Corrected the single color reference in the Wall object. Since `DarkGray` was already used correctly, I removed redundant palette entries.
2. **PaintBucket Object**: Corrected the issue with color definitions using a single color `Blue` instead of a two-color palette which was not maintained correctly in the pattern definition. This ensures consistent access to the defined colors.
