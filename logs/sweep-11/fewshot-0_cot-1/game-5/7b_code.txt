To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, let's go through the problems one by one:

1. **Invalid Win Condition**: The console output points out an issue with `No Treasures` in the win condition. In PuzzleScript, object names in win conditions should match exactly with those defined in the `LEGEND` section. The defined object is `Treasure`, not `Treasures`.

2. **Rule Format Error**: The rules must contain an arrow to separate the condition and the effect. The line after `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | ]` mistakenly includes `SFX3` as a standalone line. Instead, it should be placed on the same line or utilize appropriate syntax for playing sounds.

3. **Sound Command Misplacement**: Since PuzzleScript rules have specific syntax, `SFX3` should correctly be on the rule line, indicating an effect triggered when the rule is executed.

Here is the corrected code:

### Explanation:
- **Win Condition**: Changed `No Treasures` to `No Treasure` to match the object name.
- **Rule Correction**: Placed `SFX3` at the end of the rule line `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | ]` to indicate that the sound should play when a Treasure is collected. This corrects syntax and aligns with PuzzleScript rules format.
