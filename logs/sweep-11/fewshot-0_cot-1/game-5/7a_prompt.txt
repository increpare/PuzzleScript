=================================
line 70 : Error in win condition: "TREASURES" is not a valid object name.
line 63 : A rule has to have an arrow in it.  There's no arrow here! Consider reading up about rules - you're clearly doing something weird
line 63 : The start of a rule must consist of some number of directions (possibly 0), before the first bracket, specifying in what directions to look (with no direction specified, it applies in all four directions).  It seems you've just entered "SFX3".
line 63 : This rule refers to nothing.  What the heck? :O
line 70 : Unwelcome term "treasures" found in win condition. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this.
