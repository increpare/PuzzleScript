produced the following console output:
=================================
line 52 : unexpected sound token "click".
line 64 : Name "click", referred to in a rule, does not exist.
line 64 : Error, malformed cell rule - was looking for cell contents, but found "click".  What am I supposed to do with this, eh, please tell me that.
line 65 : A rule has to have an arrow in it.  There's no arrow here! Consider reading up about rules - you're clearly doing something weird
line 65 : The start of a rule must consist of some number of directions (possibly 0), before the first bracket, specifying in what directions to look (with no direction specified, it applies in all four directions).  It seems you've just entered "WIN".
line 65 : This rule refers to nothing.  What the heck? :O
line 51 : incorrect sound declaration.
