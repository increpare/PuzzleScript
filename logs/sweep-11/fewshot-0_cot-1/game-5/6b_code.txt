The console output indicates multiple errors in the PuzzleScript game code, primarily due to issues with section order, case sensitivity of object names in rules, and win conditions. Let's address these one by one:

1. **Section Order Issue**: The error mentions that the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section is out of order, and suggests that the "SOUNDS" section might be missing. Therefore, we need to include a "SOUNDS" section, even if it is empty.

2. **Case Sensitivity in Object Names**: PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. The error messages suggest that the object names in rules and win conditions do not match the definitions. Ensure that the object names in rules (`Player`, `Treasure`, `Wall`) match exactly as defined in the "OBJECTS" section.

3. **Win Condition Issue**: The win condition also refers to "TREASURE," which should be corrected to match the case used in its definition ("Treasure").

Based on this analysis, here is the modified code:

The above code has been adjusted to include:
- A "SOUNDS" section before "COLLISIONLAYERS".
- Correct case matching for object names in rules and win conditions.
- Corrections will allow for successful compilation.
