Upon reviewing the issues mentioned in the console output, it seems there are several syntax errors in the existing PuzzleScript game code:

1. **Comments in Wrong Place:** PuzzleScript requires that comments (`//`) be placed outside of the rules section. In the rules section, comments should not be mixed directly with rules or they can cause parsing errors.

2. **Sound Event Usage:** The rule `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | ] SFX3 // Play a sound and win when player touches treasure` is incorrect. The `SFX3` should be part of the rule and on its own separate line and should not include any inline comments.

Here is a corrected version of the game code:

### Changes Made:
- Removed inline comment from rule `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | ] SFX3 // Play a sound and win when player touches treasure`.
- Added a placeholder under `SOUNDS` to ensure the game understands SFX3 is a sound effect intended to be played.
- Ensured there was no direct commentary within the rules that could confuse the parser.
