To address the errors detected in the PuzzleScript code, we need to ensure that each object correctly specifies colors for its rendering. The current errors suggest a misunderstanding of object syntax, particularly around assigning the color attribute. Each object definition should follow the correct format, which includes the object name, its ASCII representation, and then the color specification. The issues noted in the error messages result from incorrect syntax placement and repeated keywords.

Plan of Action:
1. Ensure the objects are defined correctly with respect to their colors, using the correct syntax.
2. Review each object definition and correct any syntax errors by following the proper structure: the name of the object, its ASCII symbol, and its color on separate lines.
3. Ensure there is no repetition or misplacement of keywords.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

This version of the code ensures each object is defined with the correct syntax for color assignment. Each object definition now follows a consistent pattern: each object has its own section where color is specified separately and clearly. This should resolve the compilation errors mentioned.
