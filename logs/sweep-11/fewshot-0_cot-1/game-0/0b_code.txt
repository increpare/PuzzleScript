To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Concept**: Decide on a simple, engaging concept suitable for PuzzleScript's capabilities. Let's create a classic "Sokoban" game where the player pushes crates to target locations.

2. **Define Objects**: Identify the objects needed, such as the player, crate, wall, target, and floor.

3. **Legend**: Establish shorthand symbols for each object to make level design easier.

4. **Sounds**: Define sounds for player movement and successful actions.

5. **Collision Logic**: Determine how objects interact, especially the logic for pushing crates.

6. **Win Condition**: Define the criteria for winning a level.

7. **Levels**: Create a few levels to demonstrate the game mechanics.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code for the game:

**Explanation**:

1. **Objects**: We've defined basic game objects needed for a Sokoban game.
2. **Legend**: Provides a simple mapping for level design notation.
3. **Sounds**: Adds sound effects for player and crate movements.
4. **Rules**: Implement movement logic, ensuring crates can be pushed onto targets.
5. **Win Conditions**: All crates must be on targets to complete a level.
6. **Levels**: A few initial levels are included to showcase the gameplay.

This code sets up a fundamental Sokoban game, providing a solid base that you can expand upon with more complex levels and additional rules.
