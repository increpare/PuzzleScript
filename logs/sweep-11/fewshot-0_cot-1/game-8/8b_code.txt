To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to resolve two main errors: non-rectangular maps and the use of an undefined symbol in the level.

1. **Rectangular Map Error**:  
   The error message "Maps must be rectangular, yo" indicates that all rows in a level must be the same length. In the provided level, the second row (`#T..T#.`) is longer than the others. We'll make all rows the same length by either adding space to shorter rows or trimming longer ones.

2. **Undefined Symbol Error**:  
   The error message "Error, symbol ' ', used in map, not found" suggests that a space character is being used to represent something in the game (likely `Background`), but it isn't defined in the `LEGEND` section. To correct this, we'll add a line to define a space character in the `LEGEND` as `Background`.

Let's proceed with these fixes in the code:

```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Legend Addition**: The line `  = Background` was added to the `LEGEND` section to define a space character, which resolves the undefined symbol error.

- **Map Rectangularity**: The second line of the level was trimmed from `#T..T#.` to `#T..T# ` to ensure uniformity and maintain rectangularity, making all rows six characters long. 

With these adjustments, the errors should be resolved, and the game should compile and run correctly.
