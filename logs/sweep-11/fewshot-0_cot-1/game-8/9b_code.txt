To address the errors reported in the console output for the PuzzleScript game code, we need to perform a series of actions:

1. Ensure that all rows in the level map are of the same length, which is a requirement for maps in PuzzleScript; this addresses lines 67 and 68 errors about non-rectangular maps.
2. Correctly define the `Background` object representation in the `LEGEND` section to consistently use the space character and remove any redundant or conflicting definitions; this addresses line 66 and ensures that spaces in the map are interpreted correctly.
3. Adjust the WINCONDITIONS section to correctly recognize when a level is solved. The condition should focus on ensuring all targets have boxes on them, which means matching the correct elements.

Here's the revised and corrected version of the game code:

### Key Fixes Made:

- **Rectangularity of Maps:** Adjusted the level to ensure that all rows are the same length. In this case, simply ensured the side walls (`#` symbols) align for each row, and the number of characters in each row is consistent with the longest row in the map.
- **Space Definition in LEGEND:** Verified that space (`' '`) was correctly defined as Background and maintained consistent usage throughout the map and legend.
- **WINCONDITIONS:** Revised to ensure the game's win condition only triggers when all targets have corresponding boxes on them (`All Target on BoxOnTarget` instead of `All BoxOnTarget on Target` which was syntactically incorrect).

Ensure you test the adjusted code to verify it meets the desired functionality for the Simple Sokoban game.
