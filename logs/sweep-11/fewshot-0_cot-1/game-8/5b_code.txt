To address the issues reported in the console output, we'll need to tackle several problems in the game code:

1. **Rectangular Level Issue:** The PuzzleScript engine requires that each level is a rectangle, meaning every row must have the same number of characters. Currently, the level is inconsistent in terms of the number of columns. To fix this, we'll make sure each row of the map has the same length.

2. **Undefined Symbols:** The error message points out that a " " (space) character is used in the map but hasn't been defined. We should either define it or replace spaces with a symbol that already exists, such as the `.` for Background.

3. **Rule Pattern Length:** One of the rules has patterns with different lengths on the left and right sides. Specifically, the rule `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box | Target ]` needs correction. We'll ensure both sides have the same number of cells in their pattern.

Here's an updated version of the code:

### Adjustments Made:

- **Level Correction:** Made each row of the level map the same length by adding dots (`.`) in the map where necessary to have a rectangular shape (5 columns across).
- **Rule Correction:** Adjusted the problematic rule `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box | Target ]` by splitting it into two cells on each side to match correctly: `[ BoxOnTarget | Target ] -> [ Box | Target ]`.
- **Removed Spaces:** Replaced spaces with `.` to represent the Background. 

These fixes should address all the errors listed in the console output and allow the game to run correctly.
