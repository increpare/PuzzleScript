The error message is indicating that there's a problem with line 55 starting with "If a box is moved off a target". This is actually a comment in the code meant for the developer to explain the intent of the rule. PuzzleScript doesn't recognize inline comments, so anything that's not a part of a rule syntax might cause syntax errors.

PuzzleScript allows comments, yet they must be delimited by '//' at the beginning of the line. Hereâ€™s the fixed version of the code, with the inline comment removed:

In this corrected version, the inline comment has been removed from line 55 of the original code, making it error-free and correctly formatted for PuzzleScript.
