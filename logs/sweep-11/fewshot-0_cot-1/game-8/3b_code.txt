The error messages indicate that line 56 is causing issues because it contains a comment without the proper comment syntax. In PuzzleScript, comments must start with a semicolon (;) and need to be on a separate line. The game code below has been adjusted to fix this and ensure proper game logic and correct syntax:

Here's the reasoning for the changes:

1. **Comment Syntax**: Changed the comment regarding the rule to use the semicolon (`;`) syntax to indicate a comment, as PuzzleScript does not support inline comments in rule definitions written as plain text.

2. **Game Logic**: Verified the logic of all rules to ensure they work as intended. Specifically:
   - Moved moving logic for Player and Box in the `[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]` rule.
   - The `[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Background ]` rule updates a Box on a Target to a BoxOnTarget.
   - The `[ BoxOnTarget | Player ] -> [ Box | Player ]` rule allows a Player to move a BoxOnTarget back to just a Box.
   - The restoration rule `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box | Target ]` takes care of converting a BoxOnTarget to a Box and a Target when it is moved off a Target.

With these changes, the code should compile and function as a basic Sokoban game.
