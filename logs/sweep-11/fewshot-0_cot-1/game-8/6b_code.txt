The console output points to issues with the level map. The error messages indicate that the map is not rectangular, meaning each row must have the same length. Additionally, it mentions that a space (" ") is used in the map but not defined in the game's objects, which indicates an error in the map design or how the objects are defined.

To fix these errors, we need to ensure:

1. Each row of the level map has the same number of characters (rectangular map).
2. Ensure that all symbols used in the map are defined in the objects section. In PuzzleScript, every part of the map needs to correspond to a defined object or legend.

Examining the current map, we see inconsistencies in the lengths of each row. We can fix this by padding the rows with the Background symbol (".") to make them equal length, typically matching the longest row. 

Let's implement these fixes:

```

Here's the revised level map:
First, we'll determine the number of columns in the longest row. It appears from counting above that 7 columns seems to be the consistent expectation across most rows. We'll then adjust the other rows to ensure they all have 7 columns by padding with the Background (".") symbol.

With the corrected map in place, these changes should address the rectangular and undefined symbol errors when running the PuzzleScript game.
