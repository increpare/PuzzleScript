The error messages indicate there is a problem with the comments in the code. In PuzzleScript, comments are marked with a `#`, not `//` as you might find in other programming languages. The game script parser is trying to read `//` as part of the PuzzleScript logic, leading to the errors.

To fix the issue, I will replace the `//` with `#`. Here is the corrected version of the code:

This change should fix the errors and make the script compile correctly. The rest of the game logic and structure is left unchanged.
