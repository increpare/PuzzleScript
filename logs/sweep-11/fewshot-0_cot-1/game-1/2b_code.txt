To resolve the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to address the incorrect sprite formatting and palette color indexing for objects. Specifically, the issues arise from the improper use of periods (.) in place of palette color indexes in the sprite definitions. PuzzleScript treats sprites as matrices of numbers corresponding to a palette of colors. 

Here's the plan of action:

1. Ensure that the sprite matrices correctly use color indexes from a defined palette.
2. Make sure each sprite widget matrix is exactly 5x5 pixels.
3. Correctly assign colors to these indexes for each object within the `Objects` section.

Let's fix these problems:

1. Define a color palette within each object to map numbers to specific colors.
2. Use numbers from the color palette in the sprite definitions.

Below is the repaired version of the code:

      0 #000 // Transparent

  . = Floor
  W = Wall

  #.G.#  # Floor and Goal

```

Now the Sprite definitions are corrected to use palette colors properly, and the errors listed previously should be resolved.
