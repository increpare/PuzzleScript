To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to define several key components: 

1. **Objects:** Define the visual elements that will appear in the game, such as the player character, walls, and goals.
2. **Legend:** Map characters to objects to be used in the levels.
3. **Rules:** Define how objects interact with each other, what triggers winning or losing, etc.
4. **Levels:** Design one or more levels using the defined objects and legends.

The overall theme for this game will be a simple "Sokoban" or box-pushing puzzle. The player will push boxes onto target locations (goals).

### Plan
- **Objects:** Define a player, a crate (box), a goal, walls, and the floor.
- **Legend:** Assign characters for each object.
- **Rules:** Enable the player to move in four directions, push crates, and define the win condition when all crates are on goals.
- **Levels:** Create a simple level to demonstrate the game mechanics.

### Code Implementation
Here's a full game implementation in PuzzleScript:

```

### Explanation
- **Objects:** Defined using simple ASCII art with colors indicated. The 'Player', 'Crate', 'Floor', 'Goal', and 'Wall' objects are each represented by a different color.
- **Legend:** Assigns single characters that are used in level creation for easy readability and editing.
- **Rules:** Allow the player to push crates, move around, and check when crates are on goals to trigger a win.
- **Levels:** A small 5x5 grid demonstration level showing the player and a crate to be pushed into a goal.

This provides a simple yet functional Sokoban game where players learn how to manipulate boxes into specified areas. Adding complexity or more levels would be the next step after testing and ensuring basic mechanics work correctly.
