Upon analyzing the error messages and the provided PuzzleScript code, the task is to correct the issues related to the sprite definitions and ensure compliance with PuzzleScript's requirements. The common errors include:

1. **Sprite Size**: All object sprites must be 5x5 pixels.
2. **Color Specification**: Each sprite line should be consistent with PuzzleScript's color index specification, which needs an appropriate definition in the sprite matrix.
3. **Palette Colors**: Ensure the colors are used in compliance with their respective indices in the sprites.

Here is a plan to fix the issues:
- Adjust each object sprite to be 5x5.
- Ensure correct usage of color indices according to PuzzleScript standards.

Now, let's return the repaired version of the code:

The provided code resolves the issues by adjusting the sprite matrices to conform to the 5x5 size requirement and assigns color indices correctly. This should effectively compile and run within the PuzzleScript environment, given the error messages are addressed.
