To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Conceive the Game Idea**: I'll design a simple puzzle game concept. A good starting point is the classic "Sokoban" or a similar block-pushing puzzle.

2. **Define Game Objects**: I'll specify the main objects the player can interact with, like the player, blocks, goals, walls, and floors.

3. **Design Levels**: I'll create a few levels to demonstrate the game's mechanics and offer a challenge.

4. **Set Up Mechanics**: I'll establish rules dictating how objects interact, like moving blocks or completing levels by getting all blocks onto goals.

5. **Write the Code**: I'll implement all these ideas into the PuzzleScript language, which involves sections like Metadata, Legend, Sounds, CollisionLayers, Rules, and Levels.

Here's the complete game code:

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: Defined different game objects that will appear in the game.
- **Legend**: Maps symbols to game objects for use in the level layouts.
- **Sounds**: Short sound actions for moving and winning.
- **CollisionLayers**: Dictate how objects can interact/move into each other.
- **Rules**: Include transformation rules for object interactions; for example, when a player pushes a block.
- **Levels**: The various layout designs give an escalating challenge to solve, illustrating all mechanics.

This game represents a simple iteration of the Sokoban puzzle, offering players the ability to push blocks to specific goal locations to win each level.
