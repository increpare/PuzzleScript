To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, we need to focus on the problems reported by the console output. Let's break down the errors and implement corrections:

1. **Section Order Error**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should come after the `SOUNDS` section according to the PuzzleScript conventions. However, the error message might actually mean that the `SOUNDS` section was incorrectly placed before `COLLISIONLAYERS`. PuzzleScript sections: `LEGEND`, `COLLISIONLAYERS`, `RULES`, `WINCONDITIONS`, and `LEVELS` should come before `SOUNDS`.

2. **Sound Errors**: The sounds are incorrectly referenced using `M SOUND MOVE` and `M SOUND WIN`. PuzzleScript does not recognize keywords like `M`. Sounds should be triggered using the correct syntax without additional function-style invocations.

3. **Unexpected Token Error**: The rule referring to movement sounds contains a non-existent "M". It seems "M" was intended as a control or keyword but is not valid in this context. Sounds are triggered directly without the use of such tokens.

Let's now fix the original code with the above considerations:

```

### Corrections:
- Reordered sections placing `SOUNDS` after `WINCONDITIONS`.
- Removed `M SOUND MOVE` and `M SOUND WIN` since there are no mechanisms to trigger sounds through rules. PuzzleScript typically plays sounds when you win or move by default if defined.
- Retained the `SOUNDS` section with sound file names, assuming they are played by default during their respective actions (movement and winning conditions).

These changes ensure the game code follows the correct structure and syntax for the PuzzleScript, eliminating the errors and aligning with expected behaviors.
