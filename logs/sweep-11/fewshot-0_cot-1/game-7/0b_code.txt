To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider the essential components that make up such a game. PuzzleScript games are generally simple, grid-based puzzles or challenges that require players to achieve specific goals, such as navigating to an endpoint or arranging objects in a particular manner. The usual structure in PuzzleScript includes defining objects, specifying rules, creating levels, and describing a legend. It's crucial to keep the game straightforward because of the language's limitations and emphasis on simplicity and playability.

We'll design a small puzzle game called "Maze Escape," where the player navigates a character through a maze to reach an exit. The game will consist of basic elements: a player character, walls, and an exit. The objective is to reach the exit while avoiding impassable walls.

### Plan:
1. **Title and Author**: Start with the basic metadata of the game.
2. **Objects**: Define the game objects - player, wall, and exit.
3. **Legends**: Describe the symbols associated with each game object.
4. **Sounds**: Optionally add basic sounds for movement and winning.
5. **Rules**: Define how the player can move and what happens upon reaching the exit.
6. **Levels**: Create a few simple levels to demonstrate the gameplay.
7. **Win Conditions**: Describe the conditions under which the player wins the level.

Now, I'll provide the complete code for "Maze Escape" using PuzzleScript:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: We've defined four objects â€” a black Background, a yellow Player, a blue Wall, and a green Exit.
- **Legend**: These objects are mapped to single characters for ease of level design.
- **Rules**: Allow the player to move in all four directions without passing through walls, and define the win state when the player reaches the exit.
- **Collision Layers**: Specifies object interactions, ensuring walls are solid objects that cannot be passed.
- **Win Conditions**: The player wins when they reach the exit and it transforms into a Background space.
- **Levels**: Three simple mazes that provide increasing difficulty.

This simple game provides a basic but functional PuzzleScript experience, showcasing how to navigate multiple levels with increasing complexity.
