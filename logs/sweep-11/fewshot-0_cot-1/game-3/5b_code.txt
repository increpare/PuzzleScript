The error message indicates that there's a mention of "Pusher" in the rules section that doesn't exist in the object definitions. This happens because the object is named "Player," but the code is referencing "Pusher," which was not defined. 

To fix the code, I need to make sure all object names used in the rules match those defined in the objects section. I will replace "Pusher" with "Player" in the rules where itâ€™s incorrectly used.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

I changed the rule `[Pusher Goal] -> [PusherOnGoal Goal]` to `[Player Goal] -> [PusherOnGoal Goal]`. This should resolve the issue by ensuring all rule references are consistent with the object definitions.
