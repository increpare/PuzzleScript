To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider the core components that make up a game in this language. PuzzleScript is typically structured with sections like 'title', 'author', 'objects', 'sounds', 'collisionLayers', 'rules', and 'levels'. 

Let's outline a plan:
1. **Title and Author:** We'll come up with a simple and descriptive title and author for the game.
2. **Objects:** Define the essential objects our game will contain.
3. **Legend:** Map symbols to the objects for easy level design.
4. **CollisionLayers:** This will define which objects can overlap.
5. **Rules:** Establish rules for gameplay mechanics, dictating how objects interact.
6. **Levels:** Design a few simple levels to demonstrate the core mechanics of the game.
7. **Win Condition:** Set the conditions that determine when a level is won.

Given the simplicity of PuzzleScript, let's consider a straightforward Sokoban-style game. The player (or "Pusher") moves crates to goal positions.

Now, here's the complete PuzzleScript code for the game:

This game comprises:

- **Title and Author:** Basic identification.
- **Objects:** Background, Wall, Pusher, Crate, Goal, and their combined states.
- **Legend:** Symbols used to represent objects in levels.
- **Collision Layers:** Determines overlapping ability.
- **Rules:** Moves Pusher and Crate logically and handles goal occupation.
- **Win Conditions:** When all crates are on goals.
- **Levels:** Two sample levels illustrating the basic mechanics.

This code serves as a foundation and can be expanded upon with additional rules, objects, and levels to increase complexity and entertainment.
