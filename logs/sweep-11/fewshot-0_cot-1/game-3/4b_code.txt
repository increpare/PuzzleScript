The error message suggests that the PuzzleScript engine requires a player to be explicitly defined either in the OBJECTS section or in the LEGEND section using the keyword "player". In the given code, the object "Pusher" or its alias should be defined as the player. 

To address the error, we can update the LEGEND section to designate "Pusher" as the player using the following line: `P = Player`. This ensures that the engine recognizes "Pusher" as the player object. Additionally, since PuzzleScript requires the player entity to be referred to as "player", let's make sure we set it appropriately in the definition. Thus, the corrected object definition and legend entry should be made.

Let's incorporate this consideration into the revised code:

I have changed "Pusher" to "Player" in the OBJECTS section, and updated the LEGEND and RULES sections to reflect this change. This should resolve the error by correctly defining the player object that the engine can recognize.
