The errors in the provided code result from several issues. To address these, I need to perform the following actions:

1. **Sound Events Misplacement**: The sound events listed under the "SOUNDS" section are incorrect. These should match the actual events defined or referenced in the code. Since no sound events are used in the rules, I will remove them from the current code.

2. **Player Definition Issue**: The error, "error, didn't find any object called player," indicates that the engine needs a 'player' object reference. According to the code, the player in this game is the 'Pusher'. So, we need to declare the 'Pusher' as the 'player'.

3. **Collision Layer Adjustment**: Ensure the 'PusherOnGoal' is correctly placed in the same layer as the 'Pusher' since it is effectively the player on a goal.

Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code.

Note that the `SOUNDS` section has been removed as it was unnecessary and its content was causing errors in the compilation process. The player is implied to be the 'Pusher', which resolves the issue with the missing 'player' object declaration.
