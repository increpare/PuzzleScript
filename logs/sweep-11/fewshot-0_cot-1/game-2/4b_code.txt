Let's first analyze the code to understand the errors and fix them:

1. **Line Syntax:** The lines within the sections under `=== OBJECTS ===` are not formatted correctly.
   - Each object should have a name followed by its depiction without spaces. This includes multi-line depictions.
   - Correct object definition has three lines: name, color, and pixel representation.

2. **Multiple Equals Error:** The syntax under `=== OBJECTS ===` should be properly laid out with no extra characters or spaces in color and pixel representations to introduce errors.

3. **Missing Background in RULES:** Rules should have matching background, such as using the default object for spaces.

4. **WinConditions:** The `All Block on Goal` is correctly stated but attention should be paid to alignment and whitespace.

Let's adjust the code accordingly:

```plaintext
title Sokoban

=== OBJECTS ===
Background
color transparent

Player
color Blue
.p.
.p.
...

Wall
color Grey
.w.
.w.
.w.

Block
color Green
.b.
.b.
...

Goal
color Red
.g.
.g.
...

=== LEGEND ===
. = Background
p = Player
w = Wall
b = Block
g = Goal

=== RULES ===
[Player | Block] -> [ > Player | > Block ]
[Player | ] -> [ > Player |  ]

=== WINCONDITIONS ===
All Block on Goal

=== LEVELS ===

// Level 1
#####
#p  #
#   #
# b #
# g #
#####

// Level 2
#####
#p  #
# b #
#   #
# gg#
#   #
#####

// Level 3
#######
#     #
#  p  #
#  b  #
#  b  #
#  gg #
#     #
#######
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
- **Removed extra spaces** in the `color` and object representations.
- **Ensured consistency** in the object definitions and alignment in the code.
- The formatting within the sections `LEGEND`, `RULES`, `WINCONDITIONS`, and `LEVELS` was retained as it follows proper syntax.

This corrected code should compile and execute without errors in the PuzzleScript engine.
