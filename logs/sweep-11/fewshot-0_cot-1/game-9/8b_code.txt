The console output indicates errors mainly related to comments not being allowed within the rules section. PuzzleScript does not support inline comments or misplaced text, as only rule logic should be within the rules section. To fix this, I'll remove the inline comments that describe the rules within the `RULES` section. 

Here's the repaired version of the code:

```

I removed the comments that were within the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript doesn't support comments within this section so they caused compilation errors. The rest of the code seems structured correctly for the intended Sokoban-like game.
