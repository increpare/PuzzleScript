To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to reformulate some parts:

1. **Prelude Errors**: The line with `=======` requires exactly 6 `=` characters in each line. The first line of the game should have exactly 6 equal signs, and the first line after `title` should be be a seven equal sign line after `title`.
   
2. **Naming Conflicts in Objects**: Ensure that each "object character" in the OBJECTS section is unique within itself and the LEGEND section. The issue here seems to be using `P`, `B`, `T`, `o` as both names and legends. The icon for BoxOnTarget is `o`, but there is a conflict because the line above says `O` is already in use. The collision layers should list object names and must match their uses properly.

3. **Sound Errors**: Sound specifications must follow PuzzleScript's syntax exactly. If there are no sound events needed or planned, `SOUNDS` should be omitted entirely.

4. **Rule Error**: Rules should properly encapsulate elements in brackets, paying attention to the syntax to ensure no elements exist outside of intended areas. The issue stems from the rule `[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player ]`, which erroneously implies that the target stays.

5. **Collision Layers**: Properly group elements according to how they're intended to interact. In this code, BoxOnTarget was missing from the collision layer.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Each of the errors should now be addressed, ensuring proper syntax and logical grouping of object interactions and game state management.
