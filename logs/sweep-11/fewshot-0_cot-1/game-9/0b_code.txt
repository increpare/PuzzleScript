To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I must consider several key components:

1. **Objective**: Define a simple yet engaging objective for the game.
2. **Game Mechanics**: Decide on the core mechanics that will make the game fun and challenging.
3. **Elements and Rules**: Create the sprites, rules, and interactions needed to play the game.
4. **Win Condition**: Clearly specify how the player wins the game.
5. **Levels**: Design a few levels to start with, demonstrating increasing difficulty.

Let's create a classic Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player, represented as a character, moves boxes onto target areas.

### Plan
1. **Sprites**: Design the player, box, wall, target, and floor.
2. **Rules**: Implement rules for movement and interactions.
3. **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all boxes are on target areas.
4. **Levels**: Create multiple levels with progressive difficulty.

### Code
The following is the complete code for a simple PuzzleScript Sokoban game:

### Explanation
- **Objects**: Defines visual representations for each game object (player, box, wall, targets).
- **Legend**: Maps symbols to objects for easy level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensures specific interactions, such as walls blocking player movement.
- **Rules**: Outline how the player and boxes interact, like moving or pushing boxes.
- **Win Conditions**: All boxes must be placed on targets for the player to win.
- **Levels**: Illustrate the game environment, showing initial challenges to overcome.

This code provides a good foundation for a PuzzleScript game while allowing for expansions, such as more levels or new mechanics.
