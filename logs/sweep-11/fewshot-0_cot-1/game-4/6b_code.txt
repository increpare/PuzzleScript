The error messages indicate problems in the definition of the sprite matrices for the `Player` and `Wall` objects. These errors often occur when the characters used in the sprite matrix are not defined in the color palette. The issue looks like it might be due to undefined characters (`A`, `b`, `D`, `E`, `F`) used in the sprite matrix without corresponding color definitions in the color palette (e.g., `red`, `grey`, etc.). The colors need to be matched with sprite elements.

In PuzzleScript, each character in a sprite matrix represents a pixel in the sprite. If a character in the matrix is not defined in the color palette, the engine will generate an error.

To fix this:

1. Ensure that every character in the sprite matrix for each object corresponds to a color in the color palette.
2. Replace matrix characters with those that match the colors you have defined (e.g., `red`, `grey`, `yellow`, `green`, `orange`).
3. The simplest approach is to use dots `.` for transparency defined as `black` by default, and replace custom characters like `A`, `b`, `D`, `E`, `F` with the correct color placeholders (`r`, `y`, `g`, `o`).

This revision fixes the errors by ensuring matrix characters are converted to placeholder characters defined in the color palette.
