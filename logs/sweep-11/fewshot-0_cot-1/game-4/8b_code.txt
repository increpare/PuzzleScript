The issues in the provided PuzzleScript code stem from incorrect syntax when defining colors in the OBJECTS section. In PuzzleScript, color names are defined after the object's name, and the sprite's design is drawn using a set of numbers that refer to these colors. However, the current definitions attempt to use multiple colors without defining them properly. Each color referred to by a number must be explicitly declared in a format that allows each pixel's color on a 5x5 grid to be customized.

To fix these errors:

1. Define colors by associating each number used in the object's design with a specific color, using proper comma separators.
2. Ensure consistency across sprite color usage; every number referenced in the sprite design should have a corresponding color declared.

Let's implement these changes and correct the sprite definitions accordingly:

In this corrected version, each object with a sprite has a list of colors defined under it, ensuring that each number in the sprite corresponds to the appropriate color, rectifying the initial errors. This change should allow the game to compile without errors.
