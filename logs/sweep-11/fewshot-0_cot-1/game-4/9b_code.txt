The console output indicates a common issue with the way colors are applied to objects in PuzzleScript. PuzzleScript allows objects to be defined with multiple colored layers, but the game code provided is using only a single color per object despite trying to place additional colors in the object's ASCII art representation. Each layer of an object can be assigned a color specified after the ASCII art representation lines.

In the provided code, "1", "2", "3", "4", and "5", which represent separate color layers meant for red, grey, yellow, green, and orange respectively, are being attempted to be used, but only a single color is defined for each object. This leads to the error messages shown. The solution is to simplify the object definitions to only use a single color in their ASCII art if only one color is being defined. Or, alternatively, if you intend to have multiple color layers, you need to redefine the palette with more color sections accordingly.

Let's correct the errors by adjusting the object definitions to use patterns corresponding to one color/pixel.

This version corrects the color layer errors by simplifying the pattern representations to match the single color layer defined. Adjust the icons/colors if further design preference or enhancements are needed for better visual representation.
