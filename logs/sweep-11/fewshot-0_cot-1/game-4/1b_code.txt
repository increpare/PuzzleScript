The errors in the PuzzleScript code are related to the object declarations. Each object needs to be defined with a unique identifier followed by its text representation and then its color. However, currently, the object identifiers are directly followed by their character representation, which causes the compilation errors.

To fix these errors, I need to ensure that the color is correctly associated with each object. I'll modify the code by adopting the correct format for defining objects: using the object identifier, character representation, and specifying the color. Let's address this step by step:

1. Define the objects with their character representation followed by the color.
2. Ensure identifiers for each object are correctly positioned with their respective color on a new line after the character representation line.

Here's the revised code:

In this fixed version, I've adjusted the object definitions so that each character is properly associated with its color. This should resolve the errors observed during compilation.
