=================================
line 46 : Was expecting a sound event (like SFX3, or ENDLEVEL) or an object name, but didn't find either.
line 75 : section "LEVELS" is out of order, must follow  "WINCONDITIONS" (or it could be that the section "WINCONDITIONS"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 62 : Error, when specifying a rule, the number of matches (square bracketed bits) on the left hand side of the arrow must equal the number on the right
line 63 : Error, when specifying a rule, the number of matches (square bracketed bits) on the left hand side of the arrow must equal the number on the right
