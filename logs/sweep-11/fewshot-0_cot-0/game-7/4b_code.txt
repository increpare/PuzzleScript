### Key Fixes:
1. **Rule Correction**: Adjusted rules to have equal number of square bracketed parts on both sides of the arrow.
2. **Section Ordering**: Added the `WINCONDITIONS` section to correctly place the `LEVELS` section afterward.
3. **Sound Section**: Left a placeholder comment in the `SOUNDS` section to acknowledge its structure without causing an error.

You can now use this corrected code in PuzzleScript, and it should compile and run correctly.
