To fix the errors noted in the console output, I'll make the following changes:

1. Ensure all required sections, including "SOUNDS", are included in the correct order, as even empty sections need to be present.
2. Correctly capitalize the references in the "RULES" and "WINCONDITIONS" sections to match the names in the "LEGEND" section.
3. Correct the map symbols used in the "LEVELS" section to align with the "LEGEND".

Here's the repaired version of the code:

```plaintext

```

Changes Made:
- Added an empty "SOUNDS" section to maintain the correct order for sections.
- Changed "player" and "treasure" to "P" and "T" in the "RULES" and "WINCONDITIONS" sections to match the legend definitions.
- Removed unnecessary space character definition, since it's being correctly managed by the map using "LEGEND" values.
