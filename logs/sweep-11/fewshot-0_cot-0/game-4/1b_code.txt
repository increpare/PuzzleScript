Here's a corrected version of the code that addresses all the errors found in the original:

```

### Changes Made:

1. **Sound Definition Syntax**: Added `DESTROY` keyword in the sound definition for the treasure sound, linking it to the appropriate action.
2. **Fixed Win Condition**: Changed the win condition from `All Treasures on Background` to `No Treasures`. This captures the intention that the game is won when all Treasures are collected.
3. **Level Map Space Fix**: Replaced spaces with the defined `Background` object, to eliminate the error about the " " symbol not found. In PuzzleScript, you must define and use specific symbols in the level maps. If the " " was intended for Background, the existing definition ``.`` should be consistently used.
