### Changes Made:
1. **SOUNDS Section**: The sound identifier `treasuresound` was given a unique one-word name to avoid ambiguity.
2. **RULES Section**: Updated the rule to use `sound treasuresound` as the reference for the sound effect.
3. **WINCONDITIONS Section**: Changed "No Treasures" to "No Treasure" to match the exact object name (`Treasure` is singular and must match the object name defined in the OBJECTS section).
4. **LEVELS Section**: Made sure there were no technical errors in map specification, and space symbols were being used correctly. However, it seems `" "` is already a valid object since it corresponds to `Background`, but I reformatted to double-check during troubleshooting.

By addressing these errors, the code should now compile without the listed issues.
