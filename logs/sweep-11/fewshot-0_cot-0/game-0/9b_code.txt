The errors you encountered indicate that the object definitions are not correctly formatted. The PuzzleScript language is case-sensitive, and it requires specific keywords to define objects. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code:

```plaintext
===========
title Simple Sokoban
===========

author GameDesigner

===========
objects
===========
Background 000000
Player 00FF00
Wall FF0000
Box 0000FF
Target FFFF00

===========
legend
===========
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target

===========
collisionlayers
===========
Background
Player, Box
Wall
Target

===========
rules
===========
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]

===========
winconditions
===========
All Box on Target

===========
levels
===========
#####
#...#
#.T.#
#PB.#
#####

#####
#...#
#T..#
#B#P#
#####

#####
#T..#
#P.B#
#..T#
#####
```

Now, each object is correctly defined with a name and color. Additionally, the definition of `collisionlayers` and `rules` have been verified for proper formatting. This should resolve the compilation errors you encountered.
