To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, the metadata sections such as "title", "author", and "homepage" need to include an actual value directly after the section headers. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
===========
title
===========
Simple Sokoban

===========
author
===========
GameDesigner

===========
homepage
===========
www.example.com

===========
objective
===========
Push all the boxes onto the targets.

===========

BackgroundColor:
000000

FFFF00

```

Explanation of changes:
- Under "objects", the "on Box, Target Green" statement was removed as it had no valid section declaration and is not needed unless changing object properties or behaviors.
- Ensured all metadata sections are properly listed with values to fulfill the compiler's requirements.
