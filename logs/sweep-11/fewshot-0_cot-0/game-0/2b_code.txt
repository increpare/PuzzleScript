The errors in the console output are due to missing values for the metadata sections like `title`, `author`, and `homepage`. Let's provide values for these metadata fields to resolve these errors. Below is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

```plaintext
===========
title
===========
Simple Sokoban

===========
author
===========
GameDesigner

===========
homepage
===========
www.example.com

===========
objective
===========
Push all the boxes onto the targets.

===========

===========
BackgroundColor:
000000

===========

```

Make sure all required fields in the metadata have appropriate values. Now, this corrected code should compile without errors.
