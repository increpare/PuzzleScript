The errors in your code mainly stem from how the colors for objects are defined and how they are referenced in the legend and collision layers. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```

The main issues were with object definitions and names being incorrectly referenced in the legend and collision layers. Make sure to always use the correct object names and to define them correctly in the legend and in the collision layers. This corrected version should compile without errors.
