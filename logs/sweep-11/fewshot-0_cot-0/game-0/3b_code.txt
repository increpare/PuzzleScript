The errors you are encountering are due to formatting issues with the metadata headings. Each metadata key (like title, author, homepage, and objective) requires a value immediately following it, without separating lines of equal signs. Let's fix those issues in the game code:

```plaintext
===========
title Simple Sokoban
===========

===========
author GameDesigner
===========

===========
homepage www.example.com
===========

===========
objective Push all the boxes onto the targets.

```

In this corrected version, the metadata headers are immediately followed by their corresponding values without separating them with lines of equal signs. This should resolve the compilation errors you were encountering.
