Adjustments made:

1. Combined the two transformation rules related to `PlayerOnTarget` into one. The rule `[ PlayerOnTarget | Target ] -> [ PlayerOnTarget ]` was unnecessary since it left the target in the same state. The active transformation behavior `Player | Target -> PlayerOnTarget | Target` and its reverting `PlayerOnTarget -> Target | Player` cover both scenarios adequately.

2. The win condition statement was correct in form but has been checked for syntax clarity. These kinds of console errors often arise from misformatting or misunderstanding, but here it's mostly comprehension. The error listed about the win condition doesn't match typical syntax issues, but it's stated clearly and correctly as required.

Ensure that when testing, any Parser reference which complained about syntax aligns with legitimate rule transformations, which influences game debug outputs if constructed incorrectly.
