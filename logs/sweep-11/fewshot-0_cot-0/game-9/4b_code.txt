Certainly! The errors in your code stem from the order of sections needed as well as mismatched rule definitions. The PuzzleScript requires that all the necessary sections, like WINCONDITIONS, are placed in the correct order. Also, each rule should have the same number of patterns on both sides of the arrow. Here's the corrected version of your code:

Changes made:
1. Added a **WINCONDITIONS** section which was missing, allowing the game to compile. I used a simple condition of having no boxes off target for the player to win.
2. Corrected rules to ensure both sides of the rule have the same number of patterns. 
3. Retained the game logic, transitioning objects between relevant states.
