The error messages you're encountering suggest there might be issues with the way the sprite matrices are defined for the `Player` and `Wall` objects. In PuzzleScript, each line of a sprite matrix must be exactly five characters long, using defined colors or spaces. Let's fix those issues by ensuring each sprite matrix line is formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

Here's what I fixed:

- I ensured that the sprite matrices follow the format. Each line of the matrix must have exactly five characters for both `Player` and `Wall`.
- Compared the outputs with your definitions and ensured they match the format expected by PuzzleScript.

Please try recompiling with these changes and see if the errors persist.
