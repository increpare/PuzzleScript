The issue here is related to the win condition "No Target" in combination with the rule set. The rule essentially duplicates the player when it moves onto the target without actually removing the target. The win condition requires the removal of all targets, but this rule does not accomplish that.

Here is the corrected version of your code, with a rule that allows the player to remove the target upon contact:

```

With this adjusted rule, when the player moves onto a "Target" tile, it successfully removes the target, thereby allowing the level to be solvable.
