Here's a repaired version of your PuzzleScript code. I have corrected the sprite dimensions, ensuring they're 5x5 pixels, and adjusted the rules to ensure patterns on the left have corresponding patterns on the right of equal length.

Changes made:
1. Each object's sprite is now exactly 5x5 pixels.
2. The rule for [ > Player | Target ] ensures that both sides of the rule have equal length by replacing the Target with Background after the player moves onto it.
