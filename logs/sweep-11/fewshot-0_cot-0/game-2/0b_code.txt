Here's a simple example of a PuzzleScript game. This will be a basic maze game where the player needs to reach a goal:

This is a basic template for a PuzzleScript game. Let me explain the components briefly:

1. **Title, Author, Homepage**: Metadata about the game.
  
2. **Objects**: Define the visual and properties of game entities such as Player, Wall, Target. The colors are set in hexadecimal notation.

3. **Legend**: Maps shorthand symbols to object types used later in level descriptions.

4. **Sounds**: This section is empty in this simple example, but it's where you could define sound effects for your game actions.

5. **CollisionLayers**: Define how objects interact with each other. Objects in the same layer cannot overlap.

6. **Rules**: Define game behavior. The given rule is a simple movement from Player to Target. Rules are usually set to describe interactions between objects or object transformations.

7. **WinConditions**: Specifies what needs to happen for the game to be won. Here, all Targets need to be covered by the Player.

8. **Levels**: Defines the structure of each level using the objects mapped out in the Legend section. Each level is defined with a grid of characters.

This is a straightforward game where the player, represented by 'P', can move around to reach the target 'T' by finding a way through the walls 'W'. Feel free to expand upon it with more mechanics and rules.
