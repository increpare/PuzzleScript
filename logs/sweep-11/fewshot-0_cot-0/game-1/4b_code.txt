Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.

### Key Fixes:
1. Removed the incorrect placement of `======== SOUNDS ========`.
2. Fixed levels to be rectangular; ensured all rows in the level are the same width.
3. Corrected spacing issue in the `MESSAGES` section to eliminate any misinterpretation.
   
These changes should resolve the errors reported and allow the game to compile correctly.
