### Changes made:
1. **Removed invalid lines** following the 'LEGEND' section identifier to eliminate the parsing issue, as there should be nothing after '========' lines unless it's a comment.
2. **Corrected the level map representation**: replaced '|' with '#' to serve as boundaries since '|' wasn't defined in the legend; PuzzleScript uses '.' internally as the background so no need to explicitly define it.
