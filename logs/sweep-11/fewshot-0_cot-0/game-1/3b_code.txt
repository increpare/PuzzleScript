Here is a repaired version of the game code that addresses the errors in the console output:

Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.

I added the `# = Wall` entry to the LEGEND section to define the `#` symbol as a wall. Additionally, I corrected the win condition syntax to `All Box on Goal`. Lastly, I adjusted the level layout to correctly use the newly defined wall character.
