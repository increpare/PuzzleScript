Certainly! Let's address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code. The issues stem from incorrect section ordering, inconsistent referencing of object names, and missing sections. Hereâ€™s the revised version:

Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.

### Changes Made:
1. **Section Ordering**: Inserted an empty `SOUNDS` section to maintain proper order since `COLLISIONLAYERS` must follow `SOUNDS`.

2. **Consistent Referencing**: Ensured that object names in the `RULES` section start with uppercase as defined in the `OBJECTS` section (e.g., `Player`, `Box`, `Goal`). 

This should resolve the syntax and compilation errors encountered in the original game script.
