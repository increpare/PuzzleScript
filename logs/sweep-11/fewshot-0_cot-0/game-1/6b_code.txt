**Corrections made:**

1. Removed the erroneous `SOUNDS` section since it was empty and causing confusion.
   
2. Made sure that all level rows in the `LEVELS` section are the same length to ensure the map is rectangular.
   
3. Fixed formatting issues in the `MESSAGES` section to ensure proper parsing.

This revised code should compile without errors.
