Welcome to Push and Collect!
Move the crates onto the goals.
```

Changes made to fix the errors:

1. Added the "SOUNDS" section even though it's empty, to maintain the required order.
2. Fixed the case sensitivity issues in the "RULES" section by ensuring rule components match the case used in the "OBJECTS" section.
3. In the rules `[ Player Goal ] -> [ | Player ]` was corrected to `[ Player | Goal ] -> [ | Player ]`, assuming a more typical swap from removing the Goal, instead of making that cell empty. 

Now the script should compile without errors.
