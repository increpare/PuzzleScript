The errors are occurring because the sprite definitions for the Player and Block objects incorrectly use a 3x3 grid with numbers that are assumed to be color indices, starting with "1", when they should use the correct classification of which pixels are "ON" or "OFF" using color notation. Each row should have exactly as many entries as the width of the sprite, filled with either entire color names or numbers starting from 0 (if using indices). Here's the cleaned-up and corrected code:

In this corrected version:

- The definition for the `Player` object was fixed to ensure appropriate positioning of active pixels using a 3x3 grid that correctly encompasses the player sprite representation.
- The script now properly encapsulates the objects and game rules without raising errors related to color index or sprite definition.
