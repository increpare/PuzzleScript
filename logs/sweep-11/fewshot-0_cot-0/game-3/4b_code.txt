The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect sprite definitions for the Player and Block objects. In PuzzleScript, each sprite is defined by a specific number of characters per line corresponding to colors in the palette. It seems like there is a misunderstanding in specifying colors for these sprites. Each sprite needs to have a number of color codes that match its visual appearance.

Let's fix the sprite definitions by properly using the color codes:

Explanation:
- I replaced the numerical codes in the sprite definitions with `.` (dots) to ensure color visibility is correct. PuzzleScript uses characters to represent different colors in a sprite, with each character aligning with a defined color.
- Ensure all sprite layers consist of a consistent number of characters per line to avoid out-of-bounds errors when referencing color indices.

These changes should resolve the errors you were encountering and allow the game to compile successfully.
