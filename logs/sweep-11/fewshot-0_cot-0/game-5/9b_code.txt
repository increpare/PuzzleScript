Certainly! It appears that the levels in your PuzzleScript game currently have no path for the Player to reach the Goal. I will modify the levels to ensure that the Player can reach the Goal without any obstruction from the Walls. Here is the corrected version of your game code:

In the Above code:
- **Level 0** has been adjusted to have a pathway from the Player to the Goal. 
- **Level 1** has also been adjusted to allow the Player to reach the Goal by navigating around the Wall. 

This ensures that in both levels, the Player has a clear path to the Goal that can be navigated successfully. You can adjust these levels further based on your desired difficulty or design.
