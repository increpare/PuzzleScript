To address the solvability issues in both levels of the PuzzleScript game, let's modify the levels to ensure the player can reach the goal.

### Changes Made:
1. **Level 0 Adjustments:**
   - Moved the Player (`P`) to ensure a clear path to the Goal (`G`). 
   - The new layout removes unnecessary intervening barriers between the player and the goal.

2. **Level 1 Adjustments:**
   - Reconfigured the walls and clear areas to create a path from the player to the goal.

These adjustments make sure that every level can be completed according to the game's win condition, which requires the player to reach the goal.
