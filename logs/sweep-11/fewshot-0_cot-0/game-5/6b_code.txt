The issue with your game code is that there is no way to move the `Player` to the `Goal` due to the placement of walls or other game mechanics preventing the goal from being reached. Here is a corrected version of the code where the levels are solvable:

I have adjusted Level 0 so that the player can move to the goal:

- The goal (G) is reachable by moving the player (P) one step to the right.

Level 1 remains unchanged as it was already solvable in terms of goal placement.
