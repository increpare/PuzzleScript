The issues you're encountering are primarily due to incorrect formatting for the level declarations. Levels in PuzzleScript should be defined without commentary lines, and each level should be represented as a rectangular grid without any introductory text like "Level 1" or "Level 2". Here's the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext

```

In this version, each level is specified as a separate block of grid lines directly under the `LEVELS` section, ensuring conformity and removing level annotations.
