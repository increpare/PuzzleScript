The errors in the original code are due to issues in the rule definitions. Specifically, the first rule `[Player] -> [Player Right]` incorrectly attempts to apply a movement to a pattern that doesn't specify a target object or direction properly. Additionally, there is a typo-like structure in the second rule. 

Here's a corrected version of your PuzzleScript code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Rule Correction**: 
   - Changed `[Player] -> [Player Right]` to `[ Player | ] -> [ > Player | ]` to properly govern player movement in empty spaces.
   - Updated `[> Player | Goal] -> [Player | Goal]` to `[ Player | Goal ] -> [ > Player | Goal ]` to handle movement onto the goal square.

Both are now explicitly instructing the Player to move right while interacting with the Goal or empty spaces, which should resolve the rule-related errors.
