### Key Modifications
1. **Removed Unnecessary Comments**: The incorrect console output was referring to lines where comments about expected sound declarations might have been misinterpreted. Ensure comments within sound sections are in the correct place without code lines after them unless necessary for sound-related actions.

2. **Whitespace Issues**: There were errors reflecting issues with space symbols (" ") which are not commonly used directly in levels or other sections. It seems this might have been from other areas such as formatting or mistaken code. The provided code has been remedied to retain only necessary structural formatting within sections.

3. **Verification of Legend and Game Elements**: Checked that all elements required are declared correctly and consistently within levels and the game.

4. **Games Rules Syntax**: Adjusted emphasis on ensuring the rule syntax remained unchanged but correct within provided contexts.

By implementing these changes, the script should compile without errors and run as expected.
