### Changes Made:
1. **Sound Definitions:** Modified the sound file names in the `SOUNDS` section to be placeholders for valid file names as `sound0`, `sound1`, and `sound2` are invalid identifiers. Remember to replace `playerpush.wav`, `dooropen.wav`, and `goalreached.wav` with actual sound file names if you have them.
2. **Whitespace Handling:** Ensured any extra spaces or incorrect handling does not affect symbol parsing in maps and manifest indirectly by aligning each level with explicit `.`, `P`, etc.
