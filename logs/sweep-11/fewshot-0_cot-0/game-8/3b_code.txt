The errors in the original code are primarily due to incorrect usage of sounds and malformed rules. Additionally, the console errors suggest that there are characters used in the map definitions that arenâ€™t defined in the legend. Here's a corrected version of the game script:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Sound Event Names**: Updated the sound event names to be more descriptive and accurately mapped them in the rules.
   
2. **Fixed Rule Matching**: Adjusted the rules to maintain pattern consistency between the left and right side of the rules. Removed conditional elements that were causing errors from unmatched lengths and invalid syntax.

3. **Mapper Error Fixes**: Ensured all characters used in the level maps are defined in the LEGEND section. 

This version should resolve the highlighted errors and function as expected by the game engine.
