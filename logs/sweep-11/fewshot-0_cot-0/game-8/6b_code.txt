The errors in your PuzzleScript code appear to be primarily related to the incorrect syntax in the SOUNDS section, as PuzzleScript does not support custom comments or descriptions within the SOUNDS section. Additionally, there were some syntax issues indicated in the LEVELS section, likely due to extra spaces or incorrect formatting. Here is a fixed version of your game code:
