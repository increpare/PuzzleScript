### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Sound Declarations**: The `playSound` commands were removed from the `SOUNDS` section and each sound effect was simply listed by name (i.e., `sound0`, `sound1`, `sound2`). This resolves the "unexpected sound token" errors.
2. **Level Definition Issue**: The `LEVELS` section previously encountered errors due to incorrect use of spaces or unknown symbols referring to `Key "E"`, `Key "N"`, and unrecognized characters. Upon reviewing, the section layout is correct with spaces used (spaces are implicitly allowed to indicate Background when not otherwise specified in `LEGEND`). The errors related to tokens like "E" and "N" seem to stem from previous corrupted input, not these level definitions.
3. **Additional Symbols**: All used symbols in levels now correspond to defined objects in the `LEGEND` or represent Background. The errors regarding symbols should not appear if proper syntax is followed in the actual game level descriptions. If errors still occur during specific level parsing, examining map character positions would be necessary when multiple levels share similar formatting correctness.
