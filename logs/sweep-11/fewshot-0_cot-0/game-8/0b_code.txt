  - `Goal`: The target that the player needs to reach to win.
  - `Wall`: An impassable barrier.

- **Legend**: How each object is represented on the level grid.

- **Sounds**: Placeholder for sounds that can be associated with key game events (this is just descriptive text here as direct sound implementation isn't shown).

  - Player collects the key.
  - Player can open the door if they have the key.
  - Player wins by reaching the goal.

- **Win conditions**: Specifies how the player can win the level, by reaching the goal and having all necessary conditions fulfilled.
