Certainly! Here is a revised version of the PuzzleScript game code that addresses the errors mentioned in the console output:

**Changes Made:**
- **Sound Definitions**: Each SFX entry was updated to include a `playSound` action, such as `playSound sound0`, `playSound sound1`, and `playSound sound2` to match the PuzzleScript syntax.
- **Whitespace Issue**: Some errors concerning spaces were likely due to extra or missing symbols or formatting. I ensured that each line in the level definitions consisted only of valid symbols.

This should resolve the errors reported by the console.
