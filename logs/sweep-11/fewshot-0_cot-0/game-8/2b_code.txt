### Changes Made:

1. **Comments in Sounds Section**: Replaced text descriptions with comments `#` which are ignored by the parser.
2. **Added COLLISIONLAYERS Section**: Added the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section since it was missing and required for object interactions.
3. **Corrected WINCONDITIONS Section**: Revised the win condition syntax to use proper keywords ("All Goal").

These adjustments should fix the syntax errors and compile successfully.
