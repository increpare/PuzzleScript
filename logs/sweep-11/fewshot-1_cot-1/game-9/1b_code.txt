The error messages indicate that there are issues with the colors defined for the objects "Wall" and "Player". Each of these objects is using multiple colors in their ASCII art representation, but they have only one color specified in their color palette. To rectify this, we need to ensure that each object has the correct number of colors defined. 

Here's the plan:
1. Define appropriate colors for the "Wall" object using both `DarkGrey` and another color for the shades in the representation.
2. Define appropriate colors for the "Player" object using `Blue` and another color for the center circle in the representation.
3. Ensure that the rest of the objects have the correct color definitions.

Let's apply these fixes to the code.

In the repaired version, the "Wall" object now has two colors defined: `DarkGrey` and `Black`. The "Player" object also uses two colors: `Blue` and `White`, with `White` representing the different central color used in its ASCII representation. This should resolve the compilation errors related to color palette definitions.
