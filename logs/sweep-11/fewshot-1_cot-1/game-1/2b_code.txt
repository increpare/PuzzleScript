To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code and address the compilation errors, we'll go through each error message step-by-step:

1. **Line 35 Error**: The error message indicates that there might be an issue with the sprite or the naming convention. Specifically, object names must allow alphanumeric characters (letters a-z and numbers). We'll ensure the sprite is correctly formatted and adhere to naming conventions by checking any naming or format issues.

2. **Line 36-40 Error**: The error indicates the `Wall` sprite is trying to access an unspecified color from the color palette. We notice there are two colors specified (`#000000` and `#111111`), but only one is used. The second color is redundant or misformatted. We'll adjust the sprite to use a single color.

3. **Sound Token Error**: The error suggests that sound effects are incorrectly specified. In PuzzleScript, sound effects are typically specified only once per usage. The sound descriptions should be unique if used multiple times.

Now, let's apply these changes:

- Fix any format issues.
- Update to use a single valid color definition for objects, especially `Wall`.
- Simplify the sprite for `Wall`.
- Ensure sound names are unique for each use case in the rules.

Here's the corrected code:

### Notes:
- **Color**: The `Wall` object now uses just one color, `black`, which is defined properly to avoid color index errors.
- **Sound Effects**: The sound effects (`collect` and `playermove`) are now uniquely defined once and referenced correctly within the rules without additional identifiers.
  
With these changes, the code should compile successfully, addressing all the issues identified in the error messages.
