Let's analyze the issues step by step:

1. **Color Palette Issue:** The error "MetaData `color_palette` needs a value" indicates that the color palette line is incorrect. The PuzzleScript language requires a set type for the color palette when using the `color_palette` MetaData. In the provided script, it is not properly defined, hence any arbitrary set type isn't correctly stated.

2. **Wall Sprite Issue:** The errors related to `WALL` indicate a problem with referencing colors. The current `Wall` object uses `black` without a specified palette index, leading to an error when plotting multiple layers with number access or the wrong format.

To fix these issues, here are the steps:
- Remove the incorrect `color_palette` line entirely, as it's not necessary in the basic PuzzleScript. Colors should be defined directly in the objects using hexadecimal values.
- Define the `Wall` object with the correct color coding format using two 5-character strings (for a 2-color palette), which will accurately utilize the color definitions.

Let's fix the code accordingly:

*Notes:*
- Removed the incorrect `color_palette`.
- Changed the `Wall` object color definition to accommodate two different color indices, one for black and another for the outline if needed. This allows accurate referencing and layer plotting within PuzzleScript rules.
