To address the errors reported by the PuzzleScript compiler, let's break down the issues and resolve them step by step.

1. **Sound Tokens (Lines 54 and 55)**: PuzzleScript requires specific formatting for sounds. There's an incorrect line format used for sound definitions. We need to ensure sound identifiers are declared properly.

2. **Sound Rule References (Lines 68 and 69)**: The names "collect" and "move," used in rules, need to correspond to correctly defined sound identifiers. If "collect" and "move" are intended to be used, they need to be defined properly in the sound section. However, as of now, PuzzleScript does not use explicit function naming for sounds in rule definitions. Instead, sounds are assigned to actions directly.

3. **Legend Definitions (Lines 81 and 82)**: The error messages indicate missing mappings for "L" and "E." These are part of a likely malformed comment and aren't part of actual game data or logic. They should instead be commented out properly to avoid being misread by the parser.

Let's correct the issues:

### Notes:

- **Sound declarations:** Renamed as `sound_player_collect` and `sound_player_move` to fit the syntax where they are clearly actions in the game rather than arbitrary labelling that might be misparsed.
- **Rules:** Applied sound triggers to defined sounds directly in the rules, following PuzzleScript's methodology.
- **Comment Fix:** The erroneous lines referring to "L" and "E" were assumed to be mistakes in comment handling, already rectified by correct comment usage. 

This cleaned-up code should now work without errors and achieve the desired functionality in PuzzleScript.
