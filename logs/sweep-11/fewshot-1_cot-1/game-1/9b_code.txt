Upon review of the PuzzleScript code, there are several issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Sound Issues**: The error messages indicate that the sounds specified are not properly defined. In PuzzleScript, the sound identifiers such as `SFX0`, `EndLevel`, etc., should be followed by an integer representing the sound effect. These need to be set up correctly if you plan to use them, or the section should be removed if not used.

2. **Level Keywords**: The error messages "Key not found" indicate that the words `Level` and the numbers following are not recognized, which suggests that there may be a formatting issue with the levels. These should be preceded by a hashtag `#` which has been done in the code indicating a comment line but still being parsed incorrectly.

3. **Legend Definitions**: There is no immediate issue with the legend keys, but verify that objects (like `Gem`, `Player`, `Wall`) are defined correctly and consistently in the legend and throughout the levels.

Here's the corrected version of the code, assuming the sounds will be defined later or not needed, and making adjustments to format level definitions more correctly.

### Notes:
- The sound definitions have been commented out since the sounds were not critical and were causing errors due to their incorrect format. You can uncomment and correct them if you wish to use sound.
- The level definitions were correctly prefixed with `#`, but ensure the parser correctly interprets them. If the error persists, your current parser environment might be misconfigured. The format is standard as in many PuzzleScript implementations.
