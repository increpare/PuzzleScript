To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to make sure I cover the essential components for a functional puzzle game. These components include the title, author information, a color palette, objects with their visual representations, legends to define symbols, sounds for actions, collision layers to govern object interactions, rules that dictate how the game behaves, win conditions to determine when the player has successfully completed a level, and levels that the player can navigate.

For the purpose of this task, let's create a simple game called "GemCollector" where the player needs to collect all the gems in a grid while avoiding walls. The game will have basic mechanics to demonstrate PuzzleScript capabilities. Here's a plan and then the complete code:

1. **Title and Author:** Define the information about the game.
2. **Color Palette:** Choose a simple color palette for the game visuals.
3. **Objects:** Create visual representations for the player, gems, walls, and background.
4. **Legend:** Assign symbols to game objects for use in levels.
5. **Sounds:** Add basic sounds for movement and collecting gems.
6. **Collision Layers:** Organize objects into layers to control interaction.
7. **Rules:** Define how objects interact, such as moving over gems to collect them.
8. **Win Conditions:** Set the conditions for winning a level, such as collecting all gems.
9. **Levels:** Create several levels to illustrate the gameplay.

This plan covers all necessary elements to create a working PuzzleScript game. The game is straightforward: the player collects all gems on the grid, navigating around walls. It demonstrates the functionality of PuzzleScript with object interaction, movement, sound, and win conditions.
