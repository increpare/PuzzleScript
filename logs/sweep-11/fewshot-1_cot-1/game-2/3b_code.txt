To resolve the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript game code, I need to address the issues related to color definition in the `Wall` and `Target` objects, as indicated by the error messages.

1. **Wall Object**: The error messages imply that the `Wall` object is trying to use more colors than it has specified. Specifically, it attempts to access color number 1, but only one color (`grey`) is defined. This problem stems from the use of a multi-colored format (lines of numbers), which typically requires multiple color definitions. To fix this, I'll define at least two colors, which will match the `11111` format used.

2. **Target Object**: Similarly, the `Target` object needs at least two colors defined, corresponding to the 5x5 pattern used (`..1..`, `.111.`, etc.). To fix this, I'll define two colors for the `Target`, such as a primary and secondary color, to accommodate the design specified with numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

**Changes Made:**
- Added an additional color `darkgrey` to the `Wall` for compatibility with the multi-color pattern format (5x1 numbers).
- Added an additional color `darkred` to the `Target` to match the pattern (using a two-color format similar to the `Player` object). 

With these changes, the PuzzleScript code should compile without errors and work as intended.
