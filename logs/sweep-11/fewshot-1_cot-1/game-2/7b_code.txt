Certainly! The provided levels in your PuzzleScript game code might be unsolvable, likely because of incorrect placements of crates, players, or targets, making it impossible to complete the levels with the given rules. I'll correct the levels to ensure they are solvable.

Here's the revised version of the game code with correct, solvable levels:

These changes ensure that:

- Each level has matching crates and targets.
- The player starts in a position where it is possible to push all crates onto targets given the walls and layout.

Test these levels in a PuzzleScript environment to confirm their solvability, and make any necessary tweaks to further refine the gameplay.
