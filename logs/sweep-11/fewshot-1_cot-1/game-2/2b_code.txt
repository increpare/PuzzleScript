Upon examining the provided PuzzleScript code and the errors it generated, it's clear that there are issues with the color definitions and comments in the object definitions. The comments are being misinterpreted as color codes. PuzzleScript expects the color codes to be right after the object's name, separated by a space or a newline.

Here's the strategy to fix the issues:

1. Remove any inline comments that are being incorrectly interpreted as color codes.
2. Ensure that every object defined has the correct color codes and a pattern representing its appearance.
3. Check the collision layers for consistency across the rules and win conditions.

Now, let's provide a repaired version of the code:

This should resolve the compilation errors. I've removed the problematic comments and ensured the color definitions and character representations align with the expected structure of PuzzleScript.
