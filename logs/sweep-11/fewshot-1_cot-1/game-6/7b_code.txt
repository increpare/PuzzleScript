To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to take the following steps:

1. **Correct the `Wall` Color Palette Issue**: The `Wall` object's sprite uses color indexes (1), but only one color is defined. We need to ensure that there are enough color entries in the `Wall`'s palette to match the sprite pattern.

2. **Ensure Rectangular Level Map**: The level map must be rectangular, which means all rows should be of the same length. We need to correct the rows so they are equal in length.

3. **Define Symbol for Space**: The spaces in the level map are not recognized. Since `Background` has already been defined, we need to assign space as its symbol in the `LEGEND`.

4. **Add `CrateOnTarget` to Collision Layers**: The object `CrateOnTarget` is defined but not added to any collision layer. We need to add it to an appropriate layer.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

Key corrections:
- The `Wall` object now uses a consistent color index (previously it had a single color index but was accessing index 1).
- Added a short explanation for the symbol `.` for the `Background`.
- All level rows have been adjusted to the same length to ensure a rectangular map.
- Spaces in the map are correctly reflected by the `Background` object.
- The `CrateOnTarget` object is now included in `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
