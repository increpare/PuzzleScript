Let's analyze the errors and make the necessary corrections to the PuzzleScript game code.

### Errors Explained:
1. **Wall Object Color Access (Lines 19-21 in the error output)**:
   - Error indicates trying to access the 2nd color (`1`) of the `Wall` object, but only one color is declared.
   - The `Wall` object currently uses only the color `Blue`, which is defined as `111`. PuzzleScript expects color indices for pixel sprites to match with the number of colors provided in the definition.

2. **Target Object Color Access (Line 31 in the error output)**:
   - Error indicates trying to access the 4th color (`3`) of the `Target` object, but only one color is declared. We'll fix this by ensuring that only available indices are used.

3. **CrateOnTarget Color Access (Line 35 in the error output)**:
   - Error indicates trying to access color `3` and `2` in the sprite while only two colors are defined. We'll adjust these to correct indices.

### Plan of Action:
- Update the Wall object definition to accurately reflect the intended appearance and ensure any pattern uses the declared color.
- Adjust the `Target` and `CrateOnTarget` sprite definitions to use the available colors in their palettes. Ensure they don't reference undefined color indices.

Let's make these changes and provide the corrected code:

```

### Changes Made:
- **Wall**: Used a consistent color pattern `111`.
- **Target**: Corrected to use only one color index, and updated the sprite pattern to `0`.
- **CrateOnTarget**: Switched to use `0` and `1` which correspond to `Green` and `Brown`, and adjusted the sprite pattern to match the available indices.

These changes will resolve the compilation errors related to color indices and ensure proper sprite rendering within the game.
