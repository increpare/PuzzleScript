When reviewing the provided PuzzleScript game code, several issues need addressing to ensure the game runs as expected:

1. **Color Palette Issue for Wall**: The console outputs suggest that there is an issue with the color definition of the `Wall` sprite. The sprite must have two colors defined, but only one is provided.

2. **Incorrectly Defined Rules**: Movement rules for the player provided without an action arrow (`->`) are improperly specified. Each rule should have an arrow indicating state transition.

3. **Invalid Rules Definitions**: The rule `[on target]` is incorrectly trying to define conditions. In PuzzleScript, a condition cannot begin with a preposition like "on". 

4. **Non-Rectangular Levels**: All levels must have rows of equal length, which isn't the case here. The rows must be of the same number of characters to be valid.

5. **Misinterpretation of Movement Directions**: The way movement is attempted by directions is unclear and does not have a direct representation in PuzzleScript rules.

Here is the corrected PuzzleScript code:

**Adjustments Made:**

- Added two colors for the `Wall` sprite to resolve the color palette error.
- Corrected all movement rules to use the correct format and removed the problematic `[on target]` condition.
- Ensured each level row matches in length for a rectangular map shape.
- Reformatted rules with movement actions denoted by directions like `(right)`, `(up)`, `(down)`, `(left)` for easier interpretation.
- Redefined movement rules to follow the correct syntax with arrows indicating transitions.

Ensure your changes match the same logic you intended to implement and that levels are correctly designed to match expectations.
