To repair the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the errors related to the sprite color definitions. The errors indicate that the game is trying to reference colors in the `Wall` and `Crate` sprites that have not been defined. This suggests that the number of colors mentioned in the sprite's pixels (ones for the Wall, and twos for the Crate) exceeds the number of colors actually defined in the OBJECTS section.

For each sprite, we need to ensure that the correct number of colors are defined. The sprite matrix uses numbers to refer to the colors (0 for background, 1 for the first color, 2 for the second, etc.), so we need to adjust the color definitions accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step plan to fix the code:
1. Update the color palette for `Wall` to include three colors, corresponding to the three "1" entries.
2. Update the color palette for `Crate` to include three colors, corresponding to the three "2" entries. 
3. Ensure consistency across all sprite definitions.
4. Review the `CrateOnTarget` sprite to make sure its extra color (3) is also defined.

Below is the corrected code:

The changes include adding additional color entries for the Wall and Crate sprites, ensuring each sprite has a number of colors matching the highest number used in the sprite matrix. This should resolve the color palette errors.
