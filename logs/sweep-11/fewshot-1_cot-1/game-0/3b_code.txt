The error messages indicate that there are issues with the color definitions for the `Wall` and `Crate` objects. The errors stem from the fact that the specified indices for the colors in the drawing pattern exceed the number of colors actually defined for the object.

### Understanding the Errors:

1. **Wall Object**:
   - The error states: "Trying to access color number 1 from the color palette of sprite WALL, but there are only 1 defined in it."
   - The sprite drawing uses `1`, but only one color is defined (`DarkGray`). In PuzzleScript, we count colors starting from zero, so color `1` is indeed out of bounds since there's only a `0` color defined.

2. **Crate Object**:
   - The error states: "Trying to access color number 5 from the color palette of sprite CRATE, but there are only 1 defined in it."
   - The sprite drawing uses `5`, but only one color is defined (`Orange`). Here as well, the color `5` is out of bounds, since there's only a `0` color defined.

### Plan of Action:

- For the `Wall` object, ensure that we only use the color `0` since only one color (`DarkGray`) is defined.
- For the `Crate` object, remove references to `5` in the sprite drawing and replace them with `0`.

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Wall:** Modified lines to `00000` ensuring we only use color index 0.
- **Crate:** Modified lines to use `0` instead of the invalid `5`, ensuring compliance with defined color indices.

These changes correct the color indexing errors and should fix the aborting compilation issue, allowing the game to run properly.
