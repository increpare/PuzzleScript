To address the errors found in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to take the following steps:

1. **Fix Sound Syntax**: The error at line 54 indicates a problem with how sounds are defined. The correct format in PuzzleScript for sounds uses the keyword associated with actions like MOVE, DESTROY, etc. We need to ensure sound lines follow the correct syntax.
   
2. **Fix Sprite Graphics Size**: The error at lines 17 and 32 indicates that sprite graphics should be exactly 5x5. Some graphics are wrongly formatted and need to be corrected.

Given these steps, here is the corrected version of the game code:

### Adjustments Made:
- **Wall Sprite**: Corrected the Wall sprite to be 5x5 by adding empty lines.
- **Gem Sound Syntax**: Fixed the sound line for gem collection to use a valid action verb "DESTROY".
- **Sound Effect Usage**: Added `sfx2` after the rule that defines when gems are collected, connected correctly to issue a sound effect for collecting the gem.
