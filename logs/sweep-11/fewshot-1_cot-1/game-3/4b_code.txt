To address the errors present in the original code, let's walk through the issues and the plan to correct them:

1. **Sounds Section Error**: The error on line 47 is due to a blank line with a comment in the `SOUNDS` section. Though comments are allowed, there needs to be an acknowledgment that this section might not need rules if no sounds are defined.

2. **Rule Errors**: The rules have syntax and logic issues:
   - The rule `preserve BoxOnTarget status` and `add a background tile` are invalid because PuzzleScript rules do not use descriptive text. We should focus on game object transitions only.
   - We should replace `#` from the invalid syntax since it shouldn't appear in the natural language text used in rules.
   
3. **Handling of BoxOnTarget**: To handle boxes on targets and preserve their status correctly, the rules need to check when a `BoxOnTarget` is moved and update accordingly.

Here’s the corrected game script:

### Explanation:
- I’ve removed unnecessary descriptive text from the rules and correctly defined rules to handle box transition to and from `BoxOnTarget`.
- I’ve ensured that moving a `BoxOnTarget` still considers the `Target` underneath correctly, by using a rule to revert it to a simple `Box` and back to `BoxOnTarget` when it's on a `Target`.
- The error in the `SOUNDS` section concerning the comment line is permissible; however, clarification was added that no sounds are required.
