The errors in the code need to be addressed in order to compile the game correctly:

1. **Sound Section Error**: In the `SOUNDS` section, there's a placeholder comment which might be causing issues. If no sounds are needed, this section should be left empty or removed.

2. **Rule Syntax Error**: The rule comments are written inline with the rules, leading to syntax errors. Comments should be separate from the actual rule definitions.

3. **Incorrect Rule Syntax**: Ensure all rule transformations are inside square brackets and follow PuzzleScript syntax.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
- Removed the placeholder comment inside the `SOUNDS` section which might have caused a syntax error. If there are no sounds to add, it can remain empty for now.
- Ensured that all rule definitions are correctly enclosed in square brackets and removed unnecessary commentary within the rule definitions.
- The comments that describe rules were kept separate to ensure clarity but avoided being interpreted as part of the game code.
- Ensured the correct transformation rules for `BoxOnTarget` back to `Box` when moved off targets.
