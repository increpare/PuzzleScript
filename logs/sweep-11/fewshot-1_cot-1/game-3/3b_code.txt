To repair the PuzzleScript code, we will address the issues mentioned in the console output:

1. The first error (line 47): The error indicates an issue with the sound section, where it is expected to have sound events or object names. Since we're not using any sounds, we'll simply comment or remove the `========= SOUNDS =========` section. However, it's not causing a critical issue.

2. The second error (line 62): This error implies that there is a mismatch between the left and right-hand side patterns in a rule. Upon inspection of the rules, the error is here:
   ```plaintext
   [ BoxOnTarget | Background ] -> [ Box ]
   ```
   This rule pattern is mismatched because it attempts to transform a two-tile pattern `[ BoxOnTarget | Background ]` into a single tile `[ Box ]`. We need to modify it to correctly map the pattern length.

3. The third error (line 64): This error might be because we have a similar issue in another rule:
   ```plaintext
   [ > Player | BoxOnTarget ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
   ```
   Since `BoxOnTarget` should just transform back into `Box` when moved off the target, let's correct this.

Here is the repaired version of the game code:

In this corrected version:
- We have maintained the `SOUNDS` section but make it clear that it can be empty.
- The rules have been adjusted to maintain a consistent pattern length on both sides of each rule.
- Previously mismatched rules have been corrected to ensure BoxOnTarget is correctly transformed back to Box when expected.
