To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the specific errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Line 47 Error**: This issue likely stems from an incorrect structure in the `SOUNDS` section. However, it appears that the `SOUNDS` section is not required for this game since no sounds are defined. We can remove or comment out this section entirely to resolve the error.

2. **Line 64 and Subsequent Errors**: These errors are caused by the use of comments written in the square brackets within the rules section. Comments should not be inside square brackets; they should be outside the rule definition and preceded by a `#` symbol.

By addressing these issues, we can revise the game code. Here's the corrected version:

Explanation of Changes Made:

- Removed or commented out the `SOUNDS` section since it's not necessary for the game as described.
- Moved the comment explaining the rule out of the square brackets in the `RULES` section and used the `#` symbol to properly comment it as a standalone comment.
- Ensured the rest of the code and syntax follows PuzzleScript's requirements.
