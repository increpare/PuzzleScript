Changes made:
1. In the rules section, fixed the transition when the player moves onto a switch. The switch should convert to background once activated, hence changing `[ > Player | Switch ] -> [ > Player | ]` to `[ > Player | Switch ] -> [ > Player | Background ]`.
2. Adjusted Level 1 so that the player can reach the goal. The barrier should be correctly manipulated to open a path to the goal without trapping the player.
