Certainly! Based on the game code you provided, Level 1 doesn't seem to have any switches to toggle barriers, which is likely causing the solvability error. I'll add a switch and adjust the barriers so that the level becomes solvable. Here's the updated code:

In the updated Level 1, I added a switch (`S`) which can be used to toggle the barriers. This should make the level solvable. Feel free to adjust the placement of the switch and barriers as needed!
