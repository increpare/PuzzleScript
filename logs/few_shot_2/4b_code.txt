Certainly! To fix the errors related to the unexpected sound tokens, we need to declare the sounds properly in the `SOUNDS` section. However, the PuzzleScript engine does not directly recognize the commands as `moveplayer` and `switchtoggle`. Instead, you'll provide sound assignments using the `sfx0`, `sfx1`, etc., tags. Here's a repaired version of the code:

This change should fix the compilation errors related to the undefined sound effect tokens by defining them using `SFX0` and `SFX1`.
