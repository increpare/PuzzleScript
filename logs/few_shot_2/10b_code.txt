The error in your code was due to the use of the "_" character in the level maps, which was not defined in the legend. Below is the repaired version of the code, where I've updated the map by replacing "_" with an appropriate object that was missing in your legend definition:

I've replaced the underscores "_" in the level maps with dots "." for Background, assuming the intended objects were floor spaces. Adjust the map as necessary if another object was intended, but ensure it is defined in the legend.
