To repair the issue where Level 1 is not solvable, we need to ensure the player can reach the goal. In the current layout of Level 1, the player may be blocked by barriers which we don't have a clear mechanism to deactivate or traverse. Based on the given game mechanics, let's adjust Level 1 to make sure it functions correctly. 

Here's a corrected version of the code where Level 1 is solvable:

```

In this adjustment:
- I rearranged some barriers, added an open path in Level 1 so that the player can reach the switch, and ensured that when a switch is toggled, barriers will be replaced in a manner that allows the progression towards the goal once again.
- I added an underscore to the legend so the in-game logic will effectively handle barrier swapping as intended with switches. The underscores represent the absence of barriers or their togglable state.
