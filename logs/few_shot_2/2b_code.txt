Sure, it looks like the `Wall` and `Barrier` object definitions might contain a color index that's attempting to access a non-existent color within their color palette. To remedy this, we need to ensure that both the `Wall` and `Barrier` have correct color definitions. Here's a fixed version of the code:

Changes made:
- Corrected the color index errors for both `Wall` and `Barrier` by replacing `11111` with `.....`, indicating no pattern beyond the base color.
  
With these corrections, the game should compile without color-related errors.
