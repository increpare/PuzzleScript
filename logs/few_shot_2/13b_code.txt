Based on the description of your PuzzleScript game, it seems the first level might be unsolvable due to the placement of barriers and switches. I'll adjust the layout of Level 1 to ensure that it is solvable. Here's the revised code:

In the revised Level 1, I've adjusted the placement of the switch to ensure the player can activate it, allowing them to proceed to the goal. Additionally, I moved the barrier to ensure it's activated after the player steps on the switch.
