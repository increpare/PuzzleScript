To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to ensure the sprite definitions have the correct color palette setup. The errors indicate that the `Wall` and `Barrier` objects are trying to use more colors than are defined in their color palette. We should adjust these definitions so that they match the intended color use.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

The corrections made include:

1. Ensuring the `Wall` object uses a single color (`Black`) without attempting to access multiple layers of color.
2. Modifying the `Barrier` object to correctly define and use the color `Red` throughout, without attempting to access a second color in its palette.

These changes should eliminate the given errors and ensure the game runs as intended.
