To make Level 1 solvable, we need to adjust the placement of the Player, Switch, and Barrier so that the Player can toggle the switch to move past the barrier and reach the Goal. Here's the revised code:

In this version, the Player can move to the Switch, toggle the Barrier, and then access the Goal. This adjustment should make Level 1 solvable.
