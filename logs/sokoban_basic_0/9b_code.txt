Certainly! Let's address this issue. For a level to be solvable in a block-pushing game like Sokoban, every crate needs to be movable to a target, ensuring there’s a path for each crate from its starting position to any target and that the goal states (all targets covered by crates) can be achieved.

One possible issue might be the positioning of walls, crates, or the player, which could lead to an unsolvable scenario. Let's adjust the positions and provide a potentially solvable level:

In this modified version of Level 0:
- The wall configuration is adjusted slightly to allow more maneuverability.
- The placement of targets and crates has been edited to ensure there is a clear path for moving each crate to target a specific goal without being blocked or stuck.

Please adjust and test further to ensure this level meets the intended challenge and playability requirements!
