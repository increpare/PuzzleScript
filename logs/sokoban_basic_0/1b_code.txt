The error you encountered is due to an attempt to use multiple directions/actions in a single rule, which is not allowed. Specifically, the line causing issues might be related to the 'FastCrate' handling. I'll address these errors and provide a corrected version that should resolve the issue:

Key Corrections:
1. Corrected the rule for `[ > Player | FastCrate ]` by ensuring the FastCrate moves correctly, accounting for all possible spaces, splitting the action into sequential actions for crates that need to move beyond one space.
2. Ensured no action conflicts with combining multiple actions like pushing crates or fast crates.
3. Adjusted the rules to conform to the PuzzleScript sense of sequences, especially with considering both crates and fast crates separately.

This should help the game compile without errors. If there are further playability issues, additional rule adjustments or debugging may be necessary.
