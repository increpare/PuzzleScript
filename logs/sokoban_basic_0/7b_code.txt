The errors in the PuzzleScript code are due to the use of space characters in the level definitions. In PuzzleScript, space is not a valid symbol for representing objects on the map since it remains unassigned in the LEGEND section. Instead, you should use a defined object symbol such as "." for spaces between walls and objects.

Here's the corrected version of the code with spaces removed and replaced with the Background symbol:

This version removes the use of spaces in the levels and ensures that each element on the grid is matched to a defined LEGEND symbol.
