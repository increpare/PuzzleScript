The level might not be solvable due to a logical issue or a misplacement in your level design. Let's modify it for potential solvability, ensuring the key aspects of the game are preserved. Here's a revised version of your PuzzleScript game code, which might make the level solvable:

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Level Adjustments:** The placement of crates, targets, and other elements have been adjusted to provide clear paths and ensure you can achieve the win conditions by pushing crates onto targets.
2. **Win Condition Check:** Ensure you have the correct number of crates/fast crates matching the number of targets for a fair chance at solving the level.

Test the level to make sure the new positions allow for a solution while maintaining the intended complexity and challenge.
