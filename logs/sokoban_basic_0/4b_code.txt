The error you're experiencing is due to the use of spaces in the level definitions without specifying a corresponding legend for them. In PuzzleScript, every character used in the levels must have an associated legend. Let's modify the code to add a legend for spaces, which we'll associate with the `Background` object, indicated by a period (`.`) in the legend.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

In the corrected code, I've added a line under `LEGEND` that maps a space character to the `Background` object, ensuring the levels correctly interpret spaces as the background. Additionally, I've converted spaces to background characters in the levels to maintain visual spacing. This should resolve the error and make the game compile correctly.
