To fix the unsolvable level, let's review the winning conditions and the current arrangement of the level. To win the game, all Targets must be occupied by either a Crate or a FastCrate. Below is your corrected code with a solution that allows the first level to be solvable:

In Level 0, I've made the targets accessible and ensured that the Crate and FastCrate can be pushed onto them. The arrangement allows the player to solve the level by pushing the crates onto the targets, meeting the win conditions.
