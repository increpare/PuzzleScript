The console output indicates a couple of problems with your PuzzleScript code. Here's how to address them:

1. **Line 78 Error:** It seems that there's a misunderstanding about the 'Background' symbol in the `LEGEND` section. Instead of using `' '` (a space), consider using a symbol that hasn't been used yet, like `b`.

2. **Line 115-119 Errors:** Your level maps are not rectangular. You need to ensure each row within a level is of the same length. Add spaces (or designate another background symbol) to balance the rows.

3. **Line 117 Error:** This still relates to the undefined symbol in your map for space. Adjust it as already mentioned.

Let's fix these:

- Made sure to balance each row with either the use of the `b` symbol or spaces so they are rectangular.
- Replaced the undefined space in maps with the `b` symbol for `Background`.

This version should compile without errors.
