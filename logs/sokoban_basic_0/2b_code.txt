Certainly! The error message indicates that there's a mismatch in the pattern lengths of a rule. Let's adjust that. The issue lies with the second rule, which has two patterns on the left but three on the right, thereby breaking the pattern symmetry. The corrected rule should have the same number of patterns on both sides. Here's the fixed version of the game code:

Now the pattern lengths on both sides of the rule match, and the game should compile without the specified error.
