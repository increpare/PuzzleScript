Here’s a repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issue was with the color definitions in your objects. In PuzzleScript, each character in the sprite definition corresponds to a color index in your color palette. Both the "Wall" and "CrateOnTarget" sprites were referencing color indices that were not defined in their palette.

Modifications:
- Defined `Wall` with the correct BLACK color index.
- Ensured `CrateOnTarget` uses a valid `DARKGREEN` color, and its pattern is correctly rendered by its palette definition (only differentiating a single color shade against the existing colors).

By making these adjustments, the game should now compile without errors, and the visuals of your objects should display as intended.
