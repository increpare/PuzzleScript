The errors you're seeing are due to incorrect color palette usage in the object's graphic definitions. In PuzzleScript, the number of colors defined for a sprite should correspond with the indices used in its design pattern. Let's fix these issues by ensuring that the patterns only use colors that are defined:

I've made the following changes:

1. Updated the `Crate` sprite with correct color index `0` (BROWN).
2. Updated the `Target` sprite to use the single color index `0` (YELLOW).
3. Updated the `CrateOnTarget` sprite to use appropriate indices by consolidating into a single color index as well (GREEN).

Now the object sprites should correctly follow their defined color palette without accessing non-existent palette indices.
