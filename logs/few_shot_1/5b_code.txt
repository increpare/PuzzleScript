Certainly! It appears that the level design does not allow the crate to be moved to the target. To ensure the level is solvable, we need to adjust the initial arrangement of the game elements. Below is the revised code where the player has space to maneuver the crate onto the target:

In the revised level layout, the crate (`C`) is separated from the target (`T`) by an empty space, giving the player (`P`) sufficient room to push the crate onto the target. Now, the level should be solvable.
