The error indicates that the `CrateOnTarget` object was defined but not assigned to a collision layer. We need to add it to the appropriate collision layer. Here's the corrected version of the game code:

In the corrected code, `CrateOnTarget` has been added to the same collision layer as `Player`, `Crate`, and `Wall`. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the console output.
