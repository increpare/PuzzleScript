Explanation of Changes:
- In Level 3 and Level 4, I have adjusted the arrangements of the ice and walls to ensure that players can move the boulders to the targets successfully without getting into an unsolvable state.
- The key was to ensure that each Boulder had a valid path to move over the Target, even considering the sliding effect on ice patches.

These adjustments should allow all the levels to be solvable. If you have any more specific configurations or other levels in mind you'd like assistance with, feel free to ask!
