To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to identify the issues related to the color definitions for the objects "CrateOnTarget" and "Portal." Here's the plan:

1. **Fix CrateOnTarget Definition:**
   - The error messages indicate that the color "darkolivegreen" has been misinterpreted, possibly due to a trailing space or incorrect format. We'll check and correct any discrepancies in color names.
   - Ensure that the number of colors matches the indices used in the object pattern.

2. **Fix Portal Definition:**
   - The color "lightcyan" may also have a formatting or definition issue. We'll address this to ensure it's correctly interpreted.
   - Check and match the number of colors with the number of indices used in the pattern for "Portal."

3. **Ensure that the Color Definitions are Correct:**
   - Verify that color names are defined correctly without spaces or typos.
   - Ensure the pattern uses indices that are within the defined color range.

Hereâ€™s the revised code with corrections applied:

**Key Changes:**
- Removed any trailing spaces from color names for "CrateOnTarget" and verified the pattern uses the defined colors.
- Ensured the "Portal" color index numbers match with the provided array length in its pattern representation.
- Adjusted the pattern indices to match the available colors in "Portal."

These changes should address the compilation errors related to the incorrect color definitions and array index issues.
