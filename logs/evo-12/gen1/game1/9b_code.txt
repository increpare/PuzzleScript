To repair the given game code, we need to address the errors outputted by the console:

1. **Color Error for CrateOnTarget**: The error says the color wasn't properly defined for `CrateOnTarget`. The colors should be separated by spaces or tabs, but make sure to also start with a correct palette specification. In this specific case, replace `olive` with a recognizable color option.

2. **Sound Definition Error**: The sound definition appears to contain an error in its format. According to PuzzleScript syntax, sound effects are usually defined in either hexadecimal form or a presumed format without an additional "0".

3. **Rule Formatting Error**: The rules must be formatted using the correct syntax. There shouldn't be any arbitrary names in the rules, and we need to ensure that the rule logic strictly follows PuzzleScript's language structure.

4. **Teleport Rule**: It looks like the teleport rule isn't written with correct syntax. 

Let's correct the code paying attention to the mentioned points:

In this repaired code:

- The colors used for objects must be valid and properly structured.
- Sound definition is corrected by removing unnecessary sounds or undefined parts.
- The teleporting logic for crates is implemented using only available constructs. The initial rule `late [ Crate Portal | ] -> [ | Crate Portal ]` handles Crate teleportation properly.
- All syntax must conform to PuzzleScript formatting expectations.
