### Plan of Action

1. **Color Definitions**: The errors indicate issues with the color definitions for the `CrateOnTarget` and `Portal` objects. PuzzleScript is sensitive to color names, which need to match a specific set of valid color names or they must be defined using RGB hexadecimal values.

2. **Correct Color Names**: Verify and ensure that the colors used for `CrateOnTarget` and `Portal` are valid. The `DarkOliveGreen` and `LightCyan` colors are not recognized in their current form. We can either replace them with valid color names from the PuzzleScript palette or express them using hexadecimal color codes.

3. **Fix Palette Size**: Each color palette should exactly match the requirements of the sprite size. Adjust any palettes accordingly.

### Explanation:

- **CrateOnTarget**: Changed `DarkOliveGreen` to `Olive`, which is a valid color name.
- **Portal**: Changed `LightCyan` to `Cyan`, which is a valid color name.
- The corrections maintain within the standard color palette of PuzzleScript, which solves the initial compilation issues.
