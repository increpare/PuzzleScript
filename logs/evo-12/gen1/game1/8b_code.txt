To address the errors reported during the compilation of the PuzzleScript game, we need to examine the lines mentioned in the console output. Specifically, these errors point to missing keys (representing objects) in the legend for the third and fifth levels. The game is trying to interpret these characters (`A`, `D`, `H`, `E`, `M`, `S` ) as game objects or terrain pieces which haven't been defined.

Our plan of action is:
1. Ensure that all tiles used in the levels are included in the legend section.
2. Convert any erroneously added keys in the level definitions into valid game tiles, match the required components with the legend keys.
3. Thoroughly verify each level for consistency with the defined game objects, ensuring they only contain valid keys.

Here's the fixed code:

* The corrected code removes any usage of undefined keys in the levels by making sure each level only uses defined elements in `LEGEND` and `OBJECTS`.
* The descriptive parts of each level's objects should match defined legend entries, ensuring no spurious characters remain.
