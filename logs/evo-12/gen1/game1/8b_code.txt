To address the errors reported during the compilation of the PuzzleScript game, we need to focus on the following areas:

1. **Color Definition Error for `CrateOnTarget`:** The error indicates that the color "Olive" was expected to be a valid color scheme, but appears to be missing or improperly defined. We need to redefine it properly in the `OBJECTS` section.

2. **Graphic Pattern Issue for `CrateOnTarget`:** The current pattern for `CrateOnTarget` attempts to access indices 1-3 on its palette, which are incorrectly assumed to be mapped due to missing colors.

3. **Incorrect Definition of `Portal`:** The `Portal` object prints the error of accessing an index out of the defined color palette. It has one color defined but incorrectly attempts to use two.

To rectify these issues, here's how the corrected code should look:

1. Use a proper color scheme for `CrateOnTarget`, with distinct colors for a three-color pattern.
2. Revise the graphic patterns, ensuring color indexing matches the palette length.
3. Ensure `Portal` has a proper defined color schema and correct the pattern to use the precise colors.

This version addresses the issues by making sure that each object has a correctly defined color palette matching the intended use in their graphic patterns. The mixture of colors enables the necessary visual distinction and sets the basis for ensuring a proper and error-free execution in the PuzzleScript game.
