Upon examining the console output, we can identify the following issues in the code:

1. When defining colors for objects, there should be no trailing spaces after color names.
2. The `CrateOnTarget` object has a color discrepancy where more colors are referenced than are defined.
3. The `Portal` object also has more colors referenced in its sprite than are actually defined.

To address these errors, the following plan will be implemented:

1. Remove any trailing spaces for the colors in `CrateOnTarget` and `Portal`.
2. Ensure that the number of colors defined matches the colors used in the sprite patterns.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

This code now correctly specifies the colors for the `CrateOnTarget` and `Portal` objects with no trailing spaces and consistent color references with the patterns used.
