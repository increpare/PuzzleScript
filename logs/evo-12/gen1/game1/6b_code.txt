For Level 3 and Level 5 to be solvable, all targets should be reachable with boulders, and there should be clear paths to push them there. If the game engine still finds those levels unsolvable, consider redesigning them to ensure boulders can indeed reach targets by sliding over ice without being blocked by walls or other boulders.
