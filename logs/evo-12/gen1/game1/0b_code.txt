To create a more complex variation of the "Push the Stones" game, I will introduce a new mechanic: slippery ice tiles. On these tiles, boulders will continue to slide in the direction they are pushed until they hit a wall or another boulder. Additionally, I'll incorporate a new object, "Ice". I'll also add some new levels that integrate these elements to increase complexity and challenge.

### Plan:
1. Add a new object called "Ice". It will be a collision layer that boulders will slide over until they hit a wall or another boulder.
2. Update the rules to make boulders slide on the ice.
3. Add new levels to exploit the ice mechanic, incorporating increasing difficulty.
4. Modify the win condition if needed, but since the fundamental goal remains unchanged (all boulders on targets), the win condition stays the same.

Here's the updated code:

**Explanation:**
- I introduced the "Ice" object, which boulders can slide over.
- The movement rules for boulders on ice are defined to continuously move until they encounter a non-ice object.
- New levels incorporate these elements, offering a more challenging experience through the slipping feature of the boulders.
