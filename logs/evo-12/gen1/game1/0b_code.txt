To create a variation on the "Box Pusher" game making it more complex, I'll introduce a few new elements and mechanics. This includes a new object called a "Portal" that allows crates to teleport from one location to another and creating multiple levels with increasing complexity. 

Here's the plan:
1. Add a new object called "Portal" which allows crates to be teleported from one portal to another.
2. Implement the rules for crates to pass through portals.
3. Add more levels with varying and increasing difficulty to take advantage of the new mechanic.

Now, let's write out the complete code for this enhanced game.

This variation introduces a new strategic element to the game with the portals. Players must now think critically about how to use portals to complete levels. Each level builds on this mechanic, challenging players to plan their moves carefully.
