For Level 3, I've adjusted the positions of the walls and ice tiles to ensure that the boulders can be moved to the targets without getting irreversibly stuck. 

For Level 4, additional modifications were made to make sure the layout allows for proper pathfinding and Boulder positioning while interacting with ice, ensuring the level is now solvable.
