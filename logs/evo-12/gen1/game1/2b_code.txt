The console output indicates there are issues with the color definitions for some of the game objects, specifically `CRATEONTARGET` and `PORTAL`. The errors suggest that the colors "olive" and "cyan" are not recognized, potentially because they are not correctly written or not part of the color names PuzzleScript recognizes.

Here's the plan to solve these issues:
1. Verify and correct the color names used for the `CRATEONTARGET` and `PORTAL` objects.
2. Define a valid, recognized color palette for each sprite.
3. Ensure that each line of the object's color pattern has a corresponding color defined.

Here's the revised code with these corrections:

In this code:
- Replaced "Olive" with "DarkOliveGreen", a recognizable color from HTML color names.
- Replaced "Cyan" with "LightCyan" for the `Portal` object.
- Ensured each object definition has its color palette defined correctly.
