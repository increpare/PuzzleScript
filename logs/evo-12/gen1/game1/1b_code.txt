To address the issues highlighted in the console output, we need to correct the color definitions for the "CrateOnTarget" and "Portal" objects. The errors indicate problems with the color definitions; specifically, colors are either missing or incorrectly defined.

**Plan:**

1. **CrateOnTarget:**
   - The error message indicates that "OliveDrab" isn't recognized as a color. We should define a color palette for "CrateOnTarget" similar to the ones for other objects, using valid color names from PuzzleScript's internal color system.
   
2. **Portal:**
   - "Portal" currently tries to use a second color (indicated by ‘2’) but only one color is declared. Adding a second color will resolve this error.

This is the updated PuzzleScript game code with errors resolved:

**Explanation:**

- **CrateOnTarget:** Changed color from "OliveDrab" to a valid color "Olive."
- **Portal:** Added a second color, "Cyan," to provide the second color required by its sprite design.
  
These adjustments should resolve the errors, allowing the game to compile and run without issues.
