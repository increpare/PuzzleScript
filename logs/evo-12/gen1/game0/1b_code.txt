To address the errors in the provided code, we need to focus on two main issues:

1. **SoundVerbs Issue (Lines 50 & 51)**:
   - The console output indicates there is a problem with the sound verbs used on lines 50 and 51. In PuzzleScript, the sound verbs should be part of the allowed list such as `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`, etc. We need to make sure the sound verbs are correctly specified in the `SOUNDS` section.

2. **Rectangular Map Issue (Lines 95 - 113)**:
   - The error message indicates that the levels are not rectangular. Each line of the level should have the same number of characters to ensure uniformity. We need to adjust the row length of each level to be consistent.

Letâ€™s fix the SoundVerbs issue first by changing the custom sound verbs to standard PuzzleScript sound verbs and make the maps rectangular.

- The sound verbs for "Switch" and "Enemy" have been corrected to standard verbs `MOVE` and `CANTMOVE`.
- The levels have been adjusted to ensure all rows within a level contain the same number of characters, making them rectangular. The missing spaces have been added to keep uniformity, which is vital for correct execution.
