Based on the errors and issues from the console output, we need to address the following problems in the code:

1. **Level Consistency:** Ensure that each row in the levels has the same number of columns, making the levels rectangular.
2. **Movement Rules:** Ensure that the rules specifying movements accurately act on objects and have corresponding patterns on both sides.
3. **Enemy Movement Patterns:** The current loop for Enemy movement attempts to perform simultaneous checks and transitions without focusing on a specific item. We need to revise this to ensure each action is applied correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the game:

### Key Changes:
- **Fixed Level Dimensions:** Each level row now has the same number of columns ensuring the maps are rectangular.
- **Adjusted Enemy Movement Rules:** Simplified the movement rule for enemies to move in one direction at a time, preventing the errors related to having multiple actions.
- **Ensured Matching Left and Right Patterns:** Corrected rules by ensuring each pattern on the left has a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length.
