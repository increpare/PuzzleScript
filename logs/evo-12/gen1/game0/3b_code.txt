To resolve the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, I'll examine each error message and make the necessary corrections:

1. **Error #1 (Line 42)**: The error indicates that "olivedrab " is not recognized, probably due to the trailing space. Ensure there are no typos or spaces.

2. **Error #2 (Line 45)**: It appears that a color palette entry "OliveDrab Yellow" is recognized as one instead of two colors due to the typo or spacing, causing the game to see only one color. Ensure proper formatting.

3. **Error #3-5 (Lines 59-61)**: Given "Purple Pink" for `CrateImmune`, this should be fixed due to wrong formatting or missed color slots.

4. **Error #6 (Line 81)**: The sound format or declaration for `SFX0` could be incorrect, it appears to have extraneous input. PuzzleScript often uses `sfx0 255` without another number following it.

Now that we know these issues, I'll write a corrected version of the code.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed extra spaces after "OliveDrab" in the `CrateOnTarget` object definition.
- Ensured there are two color codes in `CrateImmune`.
- Fixed the `sfx0 255` line to suit correct syntax by removing the extra number. 

This should fix the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
