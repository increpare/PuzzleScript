I made the enemy movement use a consistent pattern by specifying directional intents in a cyclic manner (Right, Down, Left, Up) so that if an enemy canâ€™t move one way, it tries another. I have also added comprehensive enemy movement rules to loop through the directions ensuring that enemies cycle through their path when possible but aren't stuck. Adjust the maze structure and placements to ensure it's solvable. You can move players and items around and tweak wall or enemy positions as needed.
