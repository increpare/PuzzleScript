To address the errors, we'll need to make changes related to color definitions in the PuzzleScript game. Here's a breakdown of the necessary corrections, as informed by the error messages:

1. **CrateOnTarget Definition**: The console error indicates that the color defined for the `CrateOnTarget` object has an issue. The comments and secondary color weren't recognized as valid color identifiers. Instead, `OliveDrab` should be followed by an actual valid secondary color (for instance, `Yellow`).

2. **CrateImmune Definition**: The object `CrateImmune` needs to have a properly defined secondary color. The error message noted that there should be more than one color defined for this object, suggesting that just one color was given or a non-valid comment was parsed as an erroneous color.

3. **Index Errors**: These index issues likely arise from the incorrect parsing of comments, causing inappropriate indexing on color vectors (the comments might have been mistakenly interpreted as colors). After fixing problems #1 and #2, these errors should be resolved, as PuzzleScript will recognize the correctly defined colors.

Given these principles, here's the corrected game code:

This revised version should clear up the compilation errors and function as intended. The colors for `CrateOnTarget` and `CrateImmune` have been corrected, complying with the expected format.
