To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the issues reported in the console output:

1. **Error on line 44**: "Only comments should go after a bunch of equals signs ('===') on a line." This issue is likely due to the extra text included right after the `WINCONDITIONS` section title. To fix this, remove any unnecessary text following the `====` within the `WINCONDITIONS` section.

2. **Error on line 78**: "In a rule, each pattern to match on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length (number of cells)." This indicates a mismatch in the pattern size for a rule. This error is likely within the enemy movement rules: `[ > Enemy | No Player | No Wall ] -> [ > Enemy | Enemy ]`. We need to ensure the pattern sizes on the left and right sides of the rule are identical.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

**Changes Made:**
- The unnecessary text after the `WINCONDITIONS` section heading was removed, leaving a clean section title with separators.
- Corrected the enemy movement rule to ensure a matching pattern structure: The condition `[ > Enemy | No Player | No Wall ] -> [ > Enemy | Enemy ]` was modified to `[ > Enemy | no Player | no Wall ] -> [ > Enemy | no Wall ]`, assuming `no Wall` is used to allow movement through empty spaces instead of rewriting the enemy itself, as might have been unintentionally indicated there.
