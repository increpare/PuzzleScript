To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, let's first understand the problems indicated in the console output:

1. **Error on Line 49**: The error message suggests that the color specification for `CrateOnTarget` is incorrect. Most likely, you have an extra space in one of the color names or the color name is incorrect.

2. **Error on Lines 52, and 67-69**: These errors indicate that the color index accesses in the sprite definitions aren't matching the number of colors provided. The error states that an out-of-range color index is accessed.

For the `CrateOnTarget` object:
- The color `DarkOliveGreen ` has an extra space. It should be `DarkOliveGreen`.

For the `CrateImmune` sprite:
- The sprite is accessing color indexes 0, 2, and needs a third color for index 2, but only two colors are defined. You need to ensure the sprite has a sufficient number of colors defined or reduce the indexes to match the defined colors.

Let's correct these issues in the code:

**Explanation:**
- Fixed the spacing issue by correcting the color name to `DarkOliveGreen` for the `CrateOnTarget` definition.
- Added a third color (`Black`) to `CrateImmune` to ensure its sprite indexes do not exceed available colors.

The revised code should eliminate compilation errors and work correctly without console warnings.
