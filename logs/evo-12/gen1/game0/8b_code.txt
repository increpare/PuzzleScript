To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the errors:

1. **Line 44 Error**: The error indicates that only comments are allowed after a bunch of equals signs ('==='), suggesting that there is a structure improperly formatted in the provided code.

2. **Line 78 Rule Mismatch Error**: This error suggests that there's a mismatch in the number of patterns on the left and right sides of a rule on line 78. This implies that both sides of the rule must have patterns of equal length.

Here's a detailed plan of action:

- **Structure Correction**: The error in line 44 suggests a formatting issue. After a section header (like `SOUNDS`), the content should match the expected structure. `SOUNDS` may be empty, causing the confusion. Removing the equals signs following empty section headers, or properly commenting on them if needed.

- **Rule Correction**: The rule at line 78 might incorrectly interpret movement patterns for `Enemy`. Ensure both sides of the rule have matched cell numbers around the Player and Enemy.

Now, let's present the corrected code:

### Corrections Made:
- The `enemy movement patterns` rule now accounts for not moving to existing Player positions, correcting to `no Player` in the right pattern of the rule, ensuring a symmetric pattern.
- Kept each functional part of scripting where a malfunction was not indicated.
