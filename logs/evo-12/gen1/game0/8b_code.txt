To address the errors reported in the PuzzleScript code, we need to look at the color definition issues for the object `CrateOnTarget`. The error messages suggest that there's a problem with the color palette definition.

The issue arises from the fact that the colors specified need to separate base color and outline color with a space. In PuzzleScript, the assumed format for the color attributes is `BaseColor OutlineColor [optional extra colors...][BlinkColor]`. You should have at least two colors: one for the main body of the object and one for the outline. Let's correct this issue for `CrateOnTarget`:

1. **Color Specification**: Ensure that a valid color format is used in the `CrateOnTarget` definition. The palette for `CrateOnTarget` should include both a base color and an outline color.

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation:
- **Color Specification for `CrateOnTarget`**: Changed the color definition of `CrateOnTarget` from `DarkOliveGreen` to `DarkOliveGreen Black`, which specifies both a base color and an outline color. This will correct the error related to the missing color specification.
  
This code should now compile without color-related errors, allowing you to play the game as intended!
