The errors in the PuzzleScript game code are related to the `CrateOnTarget` object definition. The console output indicates two specific issues:

1. **Color Definition Issue**: The color `DarkOliveGreen` is not recognized without being properly registered in the game's color palette. PuzzleScript expects standard colors or colors defined in `color_palette` if custom.
  
2. **Palette Size Mismatch**: There seems to be an issue with the number of colors defined for the `CrateOnTarget`. PuzzleScript expects a set of colors used in a 5-character wide pattern. If there's only one color, it assumes the shape is not filled properly.

Here is a step-by-step plan to fix this:

- Replace the color `DarkOliveGreen Black` with colors that are within the default colors of PuzzleScript or within the game's `color_palette`.
  
- Ensure that there are enough colors for each pixel to be explained (at least the second and more colors) in the object's design.

Here is the corrected code, using a commonly supported color `DarkGreen` and refining the color palette to avoid any unsupported colors:

This code should now compile without errors as it uses colors that are more likely to be recognized by PuzzleScript and provides at least two distinct colors for the `CrateOnTarget` object.
