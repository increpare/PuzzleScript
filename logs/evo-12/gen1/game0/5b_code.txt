The errors in the given code can be resolved by addressing the following issues:

1. **Line 44 Error**: Generally, a commented text should not follow a separator line (`=======`). Nowhere in PuzzleScript documentation, after separators in `COLLISIONLAYERS`, should comments be present.

2. **Line 78 Error**: This error suggests that there's a mismatch in the rule pattern, where the left and right sides of the rule pattern are not of the same length. Specifically, the rule `[ > Enemy | No Player | No Wall ] -> [ Enemy | > Enemy ]` should have mirror counterparts in length and structure on both sides.

Let us rectify these issues one by one in the code:

1. **Remove any comments next to a bunch of equals signs:** Ensure there are no comments after separator lines.
2. **Correct the enemy movement pattern rule:** Supplement or rephrase the rule so that entities on the right replicate every dynamic of the left side pattern.

Now, here's the corrected code:

**Correction Explanation:**

- Corrected the pattern length consistency for enemy movement rules by ensuring a mirror counterpart layout.
- Ensured no comments are placed next to separator lines within `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
  
These modifications should resolve the errors reported during compilation.
