To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we'll need to make several adjustments:

1. **Color Error (line 48):** Ensure that the color "DarkOliveGreen" is correctly specified without any trailing spaces.

2. **Color Access Error (line 51):** Ensure that the correct number of colors are defined. Remember that each sprite needs a set of colors and should be exactly 5x5.

3. **Sprite Dimensions Error (lines 65, 66, 67, 40, 55):** Make sure that all sprites are defined as 5x5 grids. Check for extra or missing rows/columns in the `CrateOnTarget` and `CrateImmune` sprites.

Here is the corrected code:

### Summary of Changes:
- **Ensure that all color definitions are correct:** Removed any trailing spaces in the color definitions.
- **Check sprite dimensions:** All sprites, including `CrateOnTarget` and `CrateImmune`, are defined as 5x5 grids.
- **Validate number of colors used:** Each sprite now uses the correct number of colors within its definition. 

These changes should resolve the errors and make the game compile correctly.
