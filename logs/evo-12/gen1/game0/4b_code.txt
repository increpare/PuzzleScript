The task is to identify and address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code according to the console output messages. Here's a breakdown of the errors and issues to fix:

1. **Invalid Color Name**: The color "OliveDrab" is invalid, as there seems to be a trailing space. It should be corrected to remove the space.

2. **Color Palette Access Issue**: Additional colors are being accessed from the color palettes of both `CrateOnTarget` and `CrateImmune` which only have one or two colors defined. The graphics need consistent coloring representation to prevent out-of-bounds access.

3. **Graphics Dimensions**: Sprite graphics must be exactly 5x5. There are lines referring to incorrect sprite dimensions for certain objects (specifically `Target` and `Portal`).

Let's address these issues in the revised game code:

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- **Color Names**: Corrected "OliveDrab" to "DarkOliveGreen" to match typical web color names without spaces.
- **Graphics Dimensions**: Ensured that the graphics for `Target` and `Portal` are properly adjusted to be 5x5.
- **Ensured Color Correctness**: Re-assessed and matched color representations within a single sprite to ensure their internal states don't exceed defined colors.

The above changes should resolve the errors and allow the game code to compile and function correctly.
