The errors encountered in the provided PuzzleScript game code are related to incorrect color definitions for the `CrateOnTarget` object. The error messages indicate that there's a missing color name or an issue with accessing a color that hasn't been defined correctly.

To address these errors:
1. Ensure that the color names provided in the object definitions are valid and correctly spelled color names that PuzzleScript recognizes and can handle.

2. Verify that the number of colors specified in the object definition (by counting the colors provided) matches the number of colors actually used in the pattern. Each "1" or "0" in the object's pattern corresponds to a color index.

Here's a corrected version of the provided code:

Here's what was changed:
- Made sure all the color names used in the `CrateOnTarget` object are valid.
- Verified the patterns match the number of unique colors defined for `CrateOnTarget`. Each pattern should use valid indices that were accounted for in the color definition line. If the pattern was incorrect, defining hidden details adjusted the interpretation of these objects.
