To address the issues in the provided game code, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Sound Definition**: The sound `UnlockSound` is commented out incorrectly in the SOUNDS section. It needs to be an actual sound event. I will add a placeholder sound event `SFX0` for demonstration.

2. **Use of Sound in Rules**: The rule on line 62 attempts to invoke `UnlockSound` using `#`, which is invalid. Sound events need to be defined and used in the rules with the sound's name, e.g., `SFX0`.

3. **Level Layout**: The levels need to be rectangular. Adjust the levels to ensure each row is the same length by adding walls or empty spaces to the shorter rows.

Here's the repaired version:

- I added a placeholder sound `SFX0` in the SOUNDS section and used it in the rule where the player collects a key.
- Fixed the level definitions to ensure they are rectangular by ensuring that all rows have the same number of characters.
