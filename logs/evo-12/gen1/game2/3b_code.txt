To resolve the errors and produce a valid PuzzleScript game, we need to:

1. Correct the sprite definitions for "Wall". The error indicates that it's trying to access colors in the palette for "Wall" that haven't been defined. We need to define the appropriate number of colors within the inline palette for each sprite.

2. Fix the error in the rules section where objects cannot appear outside of square brackets ([]). Ensure that rules are syntactically correct and follow the PuzzleScript language conventions.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

Key Changes Made:
- I ensured that the "Wall" object uses an appropriate inline color palette that matches the dimensions of the sprite.
- Corrected rule syntax errors by ensuring that each object transformation is clearly defined within square brackets ([]), especially for rules involving target interactions. This ensures syntax correctness and logical rule structuring.
