In reviewing the PuzzleScript game code, I noticed the following issues that need to be addressed:

1. The error messages indicate that there is a discrepancy in the pattern lengths on the left and right sides of some rules. In PuzzleScript rules, the number of patterns (cells) on the left must match the number of patterns on the right.

2. Let's examine the rules section at lines 116 and 119:

   - At line 116, the rule `[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]` should not have an extra pattern on the right side of the rule, as the `Target` object doesn't need to persist separately when the `Box` moves onto it and transforms into `BoxOnTarget`. The corrected rule should directly convert `Box` into `BoxOnTarget`.
   
   - At line 119, the rule `[ Obstacle | ObstacleTarget ] -> [ ObstacleOnTarget | ObstacleTarget ]` has the same issue. When `Obstacle` is on `ObstacleTarget`, it should directly become `ObstacleOnTarget` without keeping the extra `ObstacleTarget` pattern to match the rule's left side with the right side properly.

3. We must correct these rules so that both sides have the same number of elements.

Let's modify the problematic rules to resolve the errors. Furthermore, the duplicates in each rule’s right side will be addressed. Here’s the corrected code:

With these corrections, the rules should now comply with PuzzleScript's syntax requirements, ensuring that each side of a rule has matching lengths, and the errors should be resolved.
