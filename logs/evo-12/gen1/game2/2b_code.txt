To address the errors from the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to make two primary corrections:

1. **Fixing the Wall Definition:** The error messages for the Wall object indicate that it is trying to utilize color indices that do not exist. This is a result of an incorrect color setup. The Wall object should have its colors defined correctly. Currently, only one color (DarkGrey) is specified, but the object is using a multicolor tile, expecting multiple colors to be defined.

2. **Rules Error Securing Sprite Notation:** The line error further suggests that objects were improperly used outside of brackets in the rules section. The direction around the Player with objects Box (B) and Obstacle (O) must be enclosed without any deviation or erroneous inclusion.

**Plan for Correction:**
- Define a proper monochromatic pattern for Wall and ensure all objects are correctly indexed using the color palette.
- Carefully check the rules section to enclose all object references in brackets.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:
