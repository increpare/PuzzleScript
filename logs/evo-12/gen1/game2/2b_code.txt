To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, I'll undertake the following steps:

1. **Sound Definition**:
   - The error regarding the sound token "unlocksound" suggests that the sound definition is incorrect. In PuzzleScript, sounds are usually predefined or custom sounds must be defined correctly. We'll need to remove any reference to custom sound tokens unless they are properly defined in the **SOUNDS** section with valid sound data.

2. **Rectangular Levels**:
   - The error indicating "Maps must be rectangular" implies that each row in the level map must be the same length. I'll ensure that both level definitions are rectangular by padding shorter rows with the appropriate symbol, usually the `Background`.

3. **Rule Error**:
   - There's a malformed rule due to an incorrectly placed reference to "unlocksound". It seems intended to trigger a sound upon key collection, however, since there's no valid sound defined, we'll comment it out. Once a sound is correctly defined or understood, it can be added back in.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Changes Made:
- Removed the `UnlockSound` from the rules since it wasn't properly defined.
- Commented out the `UnlockSound` in the **SOUNDS** section.
- Adjusted the maps to ensure all rows in each level are of the same length, fixing the map dimensions to be rectangular.
- Used a different pattern for colors to ensure clear color distinctions where hex codes were replaced. 

These adjustments will address the errors specified in the console output, allowing the code to compile successfully.
