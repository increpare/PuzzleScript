To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to examine the rules mentioned in the error messages. The lines with errors are due to mismatched pattern lengths between the left and right sides of the rules. Each pattern on the left side must have a corresponding pattern of equal length on the right side.

For lines 115 and 116, the rules for moving "Box" and "Obstacle" when the "Player" interacts with them seem correct, but we should confirm the syntax is both adequate and correctly align the objects with the player movement syntax (`[ObjectA | ObjectB] -> [ObjectA | ObjectB]`).

For lines 118 and 119, the mismatch occurs because patterns for creating "BoxOnTarget" and "ObstacleOnTarget" should consider cases where those objects are removed if they are no longer on targets. They must specify what happens to the spaces that are left behind.

Correcting the errors involves ensuring equality in the pattern segments. Let's update the sections:

In this corrected version:

- Each rule has matching pattern lengths across the rule components.
- The conditions maintain the original intention where boxes and obstacles interact properly with targets, and their transformations are clearly laid out.
