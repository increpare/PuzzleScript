To create a variation of the given PuzzleScript games, we'll integrate elements from both games and introduce additional complexity. The plan is as follows:

1. **Game Elements**: We'll use similar game mechanics to the original, but add new elements like movable obstacles and multiple targets.
2. **Game Mechanics**:
    - The player can push both boxes and obstacles.
    - Introduce a mechanic where certain targets only accept certain boxes or obstacles, adding an additional layer of strategy.
3. **Game Visual Design**:
    - Use distinct colors for each element to avoid confusion and improve visual clarity.
4. **Rules Modification**:
    - Modify the rules to incorporate special interactions between boxes, obstacles, and targets, ensuring more complex puzzle-solving challenges.
5. **Multiple Levels**: Design levels with increasing difficulty and introduce new concepts progressively.

Here's the complete implementation:

### Explanation

- **Game Elements**: Introduced `Obstacle` and `ObstacleTarget` to add more dynamic interactions.
- **Game Mechanics**: Players can push both `Box` and `Obstacle`. Each type must be moved to a corresponding `Target`.
- **Rules**: Rules now ensure that different objects interact with respective targets correctly (`Box` on `Target` turns into `BoxOnTarget`, and `Obstacle` on `ObstacleTarget` turns into `ObstacleOnTarget`).
- **Levels**: Levels designed to teach and challenge the player with new mechanics progressively. 

This variation adds complexity with the introduction of multiple object types and target interactions. Each level introduces a new strategy or mechanic to enhance the player's puzzle-solving experience.
