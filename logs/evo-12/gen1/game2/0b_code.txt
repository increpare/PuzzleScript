Creating a more complex variation of the game involves adding new mechanics, objects, or challenges. Here's a plan to enhance the game:

1. **Introduce New Mechanics:**
   - Add a new object called "LockedExit" that requires a "Key" to unlock.
   - Incorporate "Moving Platforms" that allow the player to be transported across walls.

2. **Add New Elements:**
   - Introduce a "Key" object that the player must collect to unlock the "LockedExit".
   - Additional "Platforms" that move automatically when the player steps on them.

3. **Update Rules:**
   - Allow moving platforms to carry the player across obstacles.
   - Unlock the "LockedExit" when the player collects the "Key".

Below is the full code implementing these ideas:

**Notes:**
- The game now requires the player to collect a key to unlock a locked exit.
- Moving platforms allow the player to move onto and carry over walls.
- New rules ensure these elements interact meaningfully within the game.
- This setup encourages a blend of puzzle-solving and strategic movement across dynamic elements.
