The issue here is with the comments inside the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript does not support comments in the form of double slashes (`//`). Instead of having comments, you can provide descriptive rule names or separate comments from the actual code to ensure clarity. Also, the `unlock` sound effect was specified but not defined within the `SOUNDS` block, so it should either be removed, or a definition should be added if the sound exists.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

In this repaired version, I've removed the comment markers and made sure the `UnlockSound` as specified in your rules actually has a definition in the `SOUNDS` section with a hypothetical sound ID. You should replace `36772507` with the actual sound ID you want to use for the unlock action.
