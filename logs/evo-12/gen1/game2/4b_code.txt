To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address a few key points:

1. **Wall Colors**: The error indicates that the Wall object tries to access multiple colors, but only one is defined. We need to add additional color definitions to match the reference.

2. **Invalid Rule Format**: The error in line 107 suggests that there is an issue with parts of the rules outside of brackets, which are interpreted as directions and not objects. We need to ensure all objects in the rule are properly enclosed within brackets.

Let's review each component and revise the code:

- **Wall Object**: It needs five color definitions as pattern includes five segments. We will add colors to the Wall definition.

- **Rules Syntax**: We need to ensure correct syntax, particularly checking the specified line 107. However, the existing rules provided do not align with one producing this exact error message. We'll assume a general typo in rules syntax and address all such potential issues.

Hereâ€™s the revised game code:

In this corrected code, we have enhanced the Wall object to include multiple colors, corrected brackets in rules, and ensured the rules conform without syntax issues, which should address the compilation errors.
