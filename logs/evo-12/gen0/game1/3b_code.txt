To address the errors, we need to examine and correct the color definitions and usage for the `CrateOnTarget` object. The error messages indicate problems with the color specifications, so let's resolve this step by step:

1. **Color Specification for `CrateOnTarget`:** The "Olive" color needs to be defined correctly. Also, it should appear in combination with "Brown" as intended for the second layer of the color palette.

2. **Graphics Representation Consistency:** Ensure the visual representation of `CrateOnTarget` matches the intended description with appropriate colors and patterns.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation

- **Color Definition and Usage:** Make sure the colors "Olive" and "Brown" are correctly understood by the game engine and are in its color palette. If "Olive" is not a recognized color, consider using a color that's present in the game engine's default palette or defining it in a custom color palette if the language permits such customization.
  
  If "Olive" remains unrecognized and cannot be fixed using the above techniques (like correcting spelling or confirming availability), replacing it with a standard color like "Green" or another color from the palette may be necessary.

- **Layer Order and Object Definitions:** Ensure that the order and definitions within `COLLISIONLAYERS` and `RULES` sections are accurate to prevent possible game logic conflicts during collisions or player actions.
