The error messages indicate there's an issue with the `CrateOnTarget` object definition, particularly concerning its color specification and usage. Specifically, the `CrateOnTarget` object color is mentioned as "Olive Brown", but only one color is recognized, which causes problems with how the colors are applied in the sprite matrix.

Let's address these issues:

1. **Color Specification**: Ensure that colors are specified correctly. PuzzleScript requires colors to be either predefined color names or hexadecimal/RGB values.
2. **Sprite Definition**: Ensure the number of colors matches with the sprite definition.

The `CrateOnTarget` object should have a clear color specification with the number of colors matching in the definition provided. Let's address this and any other parts that might potentially contain similar issues, and correct them accordingly.

Here's the revised code:

**Explanation**:
- I've separated `Olive` and `Brown` in the `CrateOnTarget` object to match the style of color definition used elsewhere. Each line specifies one of the two colors used within the sprite.
- This should allow the sprite to correctly use both colors in its artwork, addressing the color palette issue.
