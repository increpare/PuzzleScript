To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I will follow these steps:

1. **Conceptualize the Game**: Plan a simple puzzle game concept. Define a goal for the player, like reaching a destination, pushing boxes, etc.

2. **Define Objects**: Identify the types of objects necessary for the game, such as players, walls, goals, crates, etc. Each object will have a visual representation.

3. **Set Up Collision Layers**: These layers will manage how objects interact or overlap.

4. **Create Rules**: Define how different objects interact with each other and how the player's interactions affect them.

5. **Win Conditions**: Establish conditions for winning the game, like moving all crates to target spots.

6. **Design Levels**: Create at least one level for the game to be playable.

7. **Final Touches**: Include sounds or messages when necessary.

Now, I will write the code following this plan.

**Game Explanation**:

- **Concept**: This is a classic box-pushing game where the player must push crates onto target spots. A crate changes its appearance when on a target.
  
- **Objects**: The main objects are the player, crates, walls, and targets. Walls are immovable, crates can be pushed, and targets are places where crates should be placed.

- **Collision Layers**: This ensures the proper layering of objects, allowing crates to be pushed only by the player and occupying their own space.

- **Rules**: Basic interactions include pushing crates and changing crate appearance when on targets. 

- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all crates are on targets.

- **Level Design**: A small level is provided, ensuring the player has a puzzle to solve.

This game presents a straightforward puzzle, encouraging logical thinking and strategic movement to win.
