To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I will first outline the fundamental components required for the game:

1. **Title and Metadata**: Set the game title, author, and any other metadata features.
2. **Objects**: Define the game's various objects, such as the player, obstacles, and other interactive elements.
3. **Legend**: Create symbolic representations for each of the objects defined.
4. **Sounds**: Define any sounds to use, if needed.
5. **Collision Layers**: Set up layers to determine which objects can interact with one another.
6. **Rules**: Write the game's rules, defining how objects interact and move.
7. **Win Conditions**: Determine how a player wins the game.
8. **Levels**: Design one or more levels for gameplay.

The game I will design is a simple "Collect and Return" game. The player needs to collect items and return to a target location to win.

**Game Explanation:**

1. **Objects**:
    - `Background`: The floor of the game.
    - `Player`: The character controlled by the player.
    - `Item`: Objects the player must collect.
    - `Wall`: Impassable obstacles.
    - `Target`: The area that the player must return to after collecting items.

2. **Rules**:
    - The player can push in open directions (`No Wall`).
    - Collect items by moving over them, indicated by a sound.
    - Return to a target square with all items collected to win the game, also indicated by a sound.

3. **Level Layout**: The very simple level design includes walls surrounding the playable area, a player starting position, an item to collect, and a target to return to for victory. 

This setup ensures you have a simple but complete working puzzle game through the implementation using the PuzzleScript language.
