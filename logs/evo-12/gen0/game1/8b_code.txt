The error messages indicate issues with the definition of the `CrateOnTarget` object. Specifically:
1. The color "olivedrab " has an extra space, which should be corrected to "OliveDrab".
2. The sprite only has one color defined, but the drawing is trying to use more than one color index (indices 1 and 2).
   
To resolve these issues:
- Correct the color name by removing any trailing spaces.
- Add enough color indices for the `CrateOnTarget` sprite to match what is used in its design, i.e., include both "OliveDrab" and "Brown".

Here's the corrected code:

I've addressed the invalid color name and ensured the definition of `CrateOnTarget` uses both color indices as defined. This should resolve the compilation errors.
