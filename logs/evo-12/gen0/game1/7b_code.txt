To address the errors mentioned, let's reason through them and devise a plan:

1. **Color Error for `CrateOnTarget`:** The first error is that it doesn't recognize "olive " as a valid color. 
   - **Fix**: Make sure the color name is recognized by standard HTML/CSS color names. Also, remove any trailing spaces. We can change "Olive" to a generally known color like "OliveDrab".

2. **Palette Error for `CrateOnTarget`:** The second error refers to accessing colors that are not defined in `CrateOnTarget`. This means that more colors are indexed in the object's pattern than are actually declared.
   - **Fix**: Ensure the number of colors in the color declaration matches the number used in the sprite design.

Based on the analysis, let's correct the errors:

With these corrections applied, the code should now compile without errors. The main issue was ensuring `CrateOnTarget` used a valid color name and utilizing a properly defined color palette that matches the indices used in the sprite.
