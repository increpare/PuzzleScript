To resolve the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Sound Definition Syntax**: In PuzzleScript, sound definitions follow a specific format. The sound section should include definitions for sounds with identifiers, but in the code provided, there are syntax issues. We need to assign sound effect numbers properly or remove sound identifiers if custom sounds are not defined.

2. **Rule Syntax for Sounds**: There's a problem with the way sounds are activated in the rules. The syntax should ensure that the sound is played upon triggering the rule. In PuzzleScript, sounds should not be included directly in the rule definition with specific tokens like `pickup` or `victory`. Instead, you can use standard sound effects or customize them if you have specific sound IDs.

Step-by-step plan:
- Remove custom sound definitions if we don't have the sound IDs.
- Ensure the game logic works without unspecified sounds.
  
Let's create a corrected version of the game:

```

In this corrected code:
- Sounds have been omitted because the specific sound IDs were not correctly formatted or defined in the initial code. In PuzzleScript, custom sounds should follow specific definitions or default to system sounds if not explicitly defined.
- We ensure that the game logic is maintained with collision rules properly set-up for picking up keys and reaching the exit for victory.
