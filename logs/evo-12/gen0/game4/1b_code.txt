The error messages in the console output indicate that the '#' character is being used in the level design to represent walls, but '#' has not been defined in the LEGEND section. To fix this issue, we need to add '#' as a symbol for the Wall object in the LEGEND.

Here is the repaired version of the code:

```

By adding `# = Wall` to the LEGEND section, we correctly map the '#' symbol to the Wall object, resolving the error messages.
