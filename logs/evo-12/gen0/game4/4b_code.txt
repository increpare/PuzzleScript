To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code provided, we need to carefully examine the error messages:

1. **Color Error for 'Exit' Object:**  
   We need to define a valid color palette for the 'Exit' object. The error suggests there's an issue with the color 'magenta'. Since this could mean an unrecognized string or improper formatting, we'll choose a different color that is commonly supported like 'purple' instead.

2. **"With" keyword error:**  
   The keyword "with" is not supported in PuzzleScript for conditional checks in rules. Instead, we should modify our approach to check key collection.

3. **Key "S" not found:**  
   This may be related to incorrect syntax or usage within the level definition or rules. The reference might be due to improper configuration in our level goals. We should verify and ensure all variables are correctly referenced.

Let's update the script:

- Correct the 'Exit' color palette.
- Modify the door interaction rule to correctly check if the player has collected the key by using a simple rule structure, assuming a basic key-checking mechanism or manually ensuring the player reaches the door after picking the key in level design.

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation:
- The 'Exit' object color was updated to 'purple', a supported color.
- Adjusted rules for interacting with doors, such that player can pass through doors after collecting a key.
- The error about key 'S' stemmed from an assumption of mode or action missing without proper identifiers; correcting legend definitions and rules tends to resolve these within the PuzzleScript constraints.
