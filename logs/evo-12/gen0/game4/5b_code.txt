To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's examine the issues and make a plan for correction:

1. The errors listed refer to the string "Simple level to demonstrate mechanic" in the levels section, which indicates there's a parsing issue because PuzzleScript expects certain symbols and keys corresponding to defined objects in the legend.

2. Comments in the levels section should be prefixed with a semicolon `;` so that PuzzleScript treats them as non-code lines.

3. In PuzzleScript, everything inside the levels section is interpreted as level data unless it's properly commented.

Plan:
- Convert free-text lines (comments) in the levels section to actual comments that do not get parsed as level data, by adding `;` at the beginning of those lines.
- Review the levels section to ensure consistency with defined objects.

By following this plan, the errors will be eliminated, and the program should compile without issues.

Here's the repaired version:

Changes:
- Added semicolons before comments in the levels section to prevent parsing errors.
