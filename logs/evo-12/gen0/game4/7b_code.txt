To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to ensure that each rule has a corresponding pattern on the right side that matches the number of cells as the pattern on the left side. The error messages indicate that the lengths of the left and right sides of the rules on lines 80 and 81 do not match, which is a common syntax issue in PuzzleScript.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to address these issues:

1. **Understand the Rules**: The rules on lines 80 and 81 involve moving the player over keys and doors. The rules suggest:
   - Rule 1: While the player collects a key, the key is removed (but the right hand side of the rule should have the same number of positions, and in this case should just remove the Key after collection).
   - Rule 2: The player should be able to pass through doors only if a key is present. However, the code implies that the player collects keys and still passes doors, which isn't typically dependent on showing the keys in each move.

2. **Correction Plan**:
   - Adjust the right rules so they have the appropriate number of cells. For simply collecting the key, we can leave an empty space where the key was located.
   - Modify rule logic to represent collecting the key and passing through doors correctly.

Here is the corrected PuzzleScript:

```

By keeping the same number of elements on each side of the rule `[ P | K ]` to `[ P ]` and ignoring direct references to `K` in the door-related rules, the rules are now balanced correctly in terms of pattern length. This should resolve the compilation errors.
