To design a new PuzzleScript game, I need to consider the game mechanics, objectives, and overall design. Here's a plan of action to structure the game:

1. **Conceptualize the Game Theme and Mechanics**: Aim for a simple maze navigation game where the player collects keys to open doors and exit the maze. This is straightforward and can be adapted with existing PuzzleScript mechanics.

2. **Define the Objects**: Identify the key elements needed for the game:
   - Background
   - Wall (obstacles)
   - Player (character)
   - Key (collectibles)
   - Door (requires a key to open)
   - Exit (goal)

3. **Set Up the Legend**: Define characters for each of the objects, making it easy to place them in level maps.

4. **Create Rules**: Establish interactions such as:
   - Player collects keys.
   - Player uses keys to open doors.
   - Player navigates from the start to the exit.

5. **Set Sound Effects**: Assign sound effects to certain actions (if desired).

6. **Define Win Conditions**: Establish a win condition where the player reaches the exit after collecting the key.

7. **Design Levels**: Create a few sample levels to demonstrate the gameplay.

Below is a complete PuzzleScript code for this concept:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: We have a player (P), walls (#), keys (K), doors (D), and an exit (E).
- **Legend**: Maps symbolic representations to objects.
- **Rules**: Players can collect keys, and doors can only be passed if the player has collected a key (`D with K`).
- **Win Conditions**: Defined as reaching the exit tile with the player.
- **Levels**: Two levels provided. The first is simple, and the second offers a more challenging pathfinding task.

This code outlines a simple but complete game in PuzzleScript, demonstrating basic object interactions and a navigational challenge.
