To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Title and Author Information**: This includes the game's title and optionally the author's name or other related metadata.

2. **Objects**: Define the various game pieces, including how they look and their properties.

3. **Legend**: Create shorthand symbols for objects to simplify level design.

4. **Sounds**: Optional. Define any sounds that will be part of the game.

5. **Collision Layers**: Define which objects can exist in the same space at the same time.

6. **Rules**: Establish the rules that govern how objects interact with each other and how they move.

7. **Win Conditions**: Define the conditions to win a level.

8. **Levels**: Design levels that use the objects, rules, and win conditions to create playable scenarios.

For this game, I'll design a simple Sokoban-inspired game. The player will move crates onto target locations.

### Explanation:

- **Objects**: We define a background, player, crates, targets, and walls, each with a distinct color for easy recognition.

- **Legend**: Sets a single-character representation for each object for use in the levels.

- **Collision Layers**: Ensure that the player and walls are on the same layer, preventing the player from walking through walls, while crates and targets are on separate layers for independent interactions.

- **Rules**: Allow the player to push crates if there is not another crate or wall directly in front.

- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all crates are on target spaces.

- **Levels**: Design a level using the legend's symbols to set up walls, targets, a player, and crates. The player must maneuver the crates onto the targets to win.
