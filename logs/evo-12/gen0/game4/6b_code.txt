The errors you're encountering are due to incorrectly beginning a level with the line `; Simple level to demonstrate mechanic`. In PuzzleScript, level definitions should consist solely of characters that correspond to defined objects; comments such as "Simple level to demonstrate mechanic" should exist outside the level definition or use a different mechanism if supported by PuzzleScript.

Given this understanding, we need to remove the comment lines from within the level definitions. Let's rewrite the code to fix these issues:

```plaintext

In this revised version, we've simply removed the comment lines before the level definitions. Now, the game should compile and work correctly.
