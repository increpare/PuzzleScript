To repair the PuzzleScript game code, I'll first analyze the problematic rules:

The error messages indicate that there's a mismatch in the pattern structure for rules on lines 80 and 81. In PuzzleScript, both sides of a rule must have matching patterns in terms of cell count. Here's the initial problematic section:

```plaintext
[ P | K ] -> [ P ]
[ P | D ] -> [ P ]
```

These rules attempt to state that when the Player (P) moves onto a Key (K) or a Door (D), the Key or Door should be collected without player movement being obstructed. However, the right-hand side patterns are missing some structure. They should have corresponding structure like:

- When Player encounters a Key, the Key is collected, but the Player remains on a Background.
- When Player encounters a Door, the Door opens, but the Player remains on a Background.

Correcting the rules involves ensuring both sides of each rule have the same number of cells. Since this is likely an interaction between the Player and these objects, they should be reflected in a two-part pattern.

Here's how to fix the rules:

```plaintext
[ Player | Key ] -> [ Player | Background ]
[ Player | Door ] -> [ Player | Background ]
```

Now let's put it all together with the repaired code:

This will fix the errors and allow the game to work as intended, where collecting keys and doors doesn't obstruct player movement.
