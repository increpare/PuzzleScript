The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the pattern matching within the `RULES` section. Specifically, each rule pattern that checks for conditions on the left side of the rule must have a corresponding pattern of the same size on the right side of the rule.

In the provided code, the rules are currently defined as:
```plaintext
[ Player | Crate | No Crate No Wall ] -> [ > Player | > Crate ]
[ > Player | No Crate No Wall ] -> [ > Player ]
```

The issue here is that the left-side pattern `[ Player | Crate | No Crate No Wall ]` has three components, but the right-side pattern `[ > Player | > Crate ]` has only two. Similarly, the left-side pattern `[ > Player | No Crate No Wall ]` includes three components, but the right-side pattern `[ > Player ]` has only one.

To fix these errors, we need to ensure that the left and right sides of each rule have the same number of cells. One approach is to adjust the rules so that each side consistently represents the same conditions across the involved components:

Here's a corrected version of the script:

Each rule on the left side now perfectly matches the right side in terms of the number of placeholders, thus resolving the compilation errors while maintaining the intended behavior for `Player` and `Crate` movement in the game.
