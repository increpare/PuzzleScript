The error in the code arises from the rule `[ B | T ] -> [ X | T ]`, which doesn't have equal-length patterns on the left and right sides of the rule. Specifically, the right side of the rule should convert a Box on a Target into a BoxOnTarget, and since BoxOnTarget already represents both a Box and a Target, we don't need the extra `T` on the right side. Here's how we can fix this:

For the rule `[ B | T ] -> [ X | T ]`, we should have it as `[ B | T ] -> [ X ]` because `X` already satisfies the conditions of a Box being on a Target.

Let's remove the redundant `T` on the right-hand side of the rule `[ B | T ] -> [ X | T ]`, achieving the correct syntax and functionality.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

This correction ensures that the rule correctly transforms a Box on a Target to BoxOnTarget without violating equal-length constraint for pattern matching.
