To address the errors shown in the console output, we need to ensure that the color definitions in the Gem and Target objects match the indices we're trying to access in the sprite designs. Let's break down the tasks required to fix the issues:

1. **Gem Object Fix:** 
   - The error indicates we're trying to access color index `2`, but only two colors (indices `0` and `1`) are defined.
   - Update the Gem sprite design to only use indices `0` and `1`.

2. **Target Object Fix:** 
   - The error indicates we're trying to access color index `3`, but only one color is defined.
   - Update the Target sprite design to ensure it only uses indices `0`.

Here's the corrected code:

### Summary of Changes:
- **Gem Sprite:** Changed the design to use indices `0` and `1` instead of nonexistent `2`.
- **Target Sprite:** Changed the design to use index `0` only, since only one color is defined.

These changes ensure that the game compiles correctly without color access errors, and the intended visual appearance is maintained within the existing constraints.
