To fix the issues present in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address several errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Unexpected text in sounds section:** The line indicating "# No sounds defined for this simple game" is mistakenly placed inside the `SOUNDS` section where it shouldn't be. Sounds section can be left empty if no sounds are needed.

2. **Rule misinterpretation due to comments:** The comments within the `RULES` section are mistakenly interpreted as rules because PuzzleScript does not support inline comments within sections.

3. **Unknown symbols in levels:** The presence of `L` and `E` in levels was cited as an error, likely due to a misinterpretation or typo.

4. **Inconsistent use of `BoxOnTarget` object:** In the rules section, swapping between `Box` and `BoxOnTarget` should be handled more appropriately to ensure the logic is sound.

Considering the issues above, here is the repaired version of the code:

In this version, I've ensured comments are placed where they do not interfere with the section syntax, and the rules and object names are correctly utilized. Additionally, I verified level configurations to correspond to the symbols in the legend.
