Certainly! The error indicates that the levels can't be solved under the current rules and win conditions. Most likely, this issue is due to incorrect definitions or misalignments of objectives in levels.

Here's the revised and complete code with potentially solvable levels:

Changes made:

1. Revised win conditions to target crates being on goals specifically.
2. Adjusted levels to ensure there are no unreachable areas or incorrect crate/goal configurations.
3. Added the `[ C | > G ] -> [ C | > G ]` rule to maintain interaction representation, if intending to cover moving crates onto goals correctly.

Please test this setup and tweak the levels further to ensure full solvability.
