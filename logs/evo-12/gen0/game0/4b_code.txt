To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's first break down the issues:

1. **Sound Event Expected Issue**: The error states that a sound event or object name is expected but wasn't found. It is likely related to rule definitions mistakenly looking for a sound event immediately following a rule. This can be ignored if no sound is needed.

2. **Key Errors (semicolon and characters not found)**: These errors are due to the comments starting with `;` and lines incorrectly formatted in level definition. PuzzleScript doesn't support comments using semicolons or any characters that aren't defined as objects.

3. **Level Lines Not Rectangular**: The levels must be rectangular, meaning all rows should have the same number of columns.

These are the steps to resolve these issues:

- Remove comments in the code.
- Ensure each level's rows are the same length.

Let's fix the code accordingly:

### Explanation:

- **Comments Removed**: Removed comments indicated by semicolons.
- **Rectangular Levels**: Made sure all rows for each level have the same number of columns to ensure they are rectangular. It appears level 1 was missing a column in some rows, so it was adjusted.
- **Sound Events**: Confirmed that no sounds are needed, so there are no specific sound events.

With these adjustments, the game should compile without the aforementioned errors.
