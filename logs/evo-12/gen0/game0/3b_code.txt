To fix the errors outlined in the console output, we need to carefully address each issue reported:

1. **line 67 : Was expecting a sound event...**: There's an empty sound section with no events defined. Since no sounds are being used, this section can be safely removed.

2. **Key "L", "E", "V", "1" not found...**: This means there are unexplained characters appearing in the levels. This often happens when a line like `# Level 1` is interpreted as part of a level due to incorrect commenting. PuzzleScript uses semicolons for comments, so these lines should be commented out.

3. **Maps must be rectangular**: The levels need to have consistent row lengths. Adjusting whitespace or adding background tiles to ensure all rows are of equal length can resolve this.

Let's go through the game code and make the necessary changes:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Comments**: Level descriptors (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, etc.) are now properly commented out with `;`.
- **Rectangular Levels**: Ensured that all rows within a level have the same number of characters by adjusting whitespace or additional characters where necessary (e.g., adding an extra `#` in Level 1's border to match others).
- **Sounds Section Removed**: Since there are no sound effects defined, the sound declarations are not required.

This should address the errors and make your PuzzleScript game compile and run correctly.
