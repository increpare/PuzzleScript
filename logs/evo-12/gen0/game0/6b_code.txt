To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's address them one by one:

1. **Sound Event Error**: The console output indicates an issue with the expected "sound event" after line 67. However, based on the code, the `SOUNDS` section only mentions `# No sounds needed`. To fix this, we can remove the `=========` and `# No sounds needed` lines from the `SOUNDS` section.

2. **Rectangular Map Error**: The levels must be rectangular with each row having the same length. Let's inspect the `LEVELS` section to ensure all rows in each level have the same number of columns. The levels are structured incorrectly, so let's correct the assumed layout of the levels.

3. **Rule Length Error**: For each rule, patterns on the left and right sides must be the same length. Specifically, rules must match both sides in terms of the number of objects or cells. We should review and modify these rules so they match correctly.

Now let's implement these corrections in the code.

**Explanation of Fixes:**
- **Removed the SOUNDS section header and comment** to remove the confusion about expected sound events.
- **Fixed Level maps to be rectangular** by ensuring all lines have the same length in each level.
- **Corrected rules to ensure that they are equal on both sides**, particularly the `[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Target ]` rule was updated to include "Target" on the right side, ensuring balanced transformation logic.
