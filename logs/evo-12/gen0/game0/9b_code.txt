The errors reported are related to the rules defined in the `RULES` section of the code. Specifically, there are issues with these rules where the patterns on the left side do not correspond to the patterns on the right side with the same number of cells.

Looking through the existing rules, the problematic ones are:

```plaintext
[ X | no T ] -> [ B ]
[ P | X ] -> [ P | X ]
[ X | P ] -> [ X | P ]
```

These rules are incorrect because they try to match multiple conditions (`X` and `no T`) on the left but don't maintain the same pattern on the right.

Correcting the rules involves ensuring that every matched pattern on the left and its transformation on the right are aligned, meaning if the pattern contains two conditions (or two entities), then the result should also maintain the same number of entities (in two conditions) to ensure equivalence.

Here's the corrected version of the `RULES` section:

```plaintext
RULES
======

[ > P | B ] -> [ > P | > B ]
[ P | T ] -> [ P | T ]

[ B | T ] -> [ X ]
[ X | no T ] -> [ B | no T ]

[ P | X ] -> [ P | X ]
[ X | P ] -> [ X | P ]
```

Let's incorporate the fixed rules into the full game code:

This will resolve the error messages about the patterns in the rules.
