To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we'll need to outline the various components necessary for the game to function. Here's an overview of what we'll include:

1. **Title and Author**: Every PuzzleScript game starts with these to provide context about the game and its creator.
2. **Objects**: Define the visual elements we need in the game such as the player, goals, obstacles, and background. To keep it simple, let's consider a basic game with a player, targets, walls, and a collectible item.
3. **Legend**: Assign shorthand symbols to the objects for use in defining levels.
4. **Sounds**: Optionally include sound effects within the game. For simplicity, we may skip this or provide a default sound setting.
5. **Collision Layers**: Define how objects will interact with each other, ensuring that logical layers are established.
6. **Rules**: Define the rules for movement and interactions between objects.
7. **Win Conditions**: Determine what needs to happen for the player to win the game.
8. **Levels**: Set up the puzzles or scenarios the player must navigate to achieve the win condition.

Plan:
- Title the game "Gem Collector" to create a simple game where the player collects all gems to win.
- Define a small set of objects: Player, Gem, Wall, Target (to mark where collected gems go), and Background.
- Create a basic collision layer setup and rules for collecting gems.
- Define a few simple levels to play through.

Now, let's write the complete game code.

In this game, the player (`P`) moves around the map to collect gems (`G`) and return them to targets (`T`). The game is won when all targets are covered by gems. Each level presents a different maze-like challenge with walls (`#`) that the player must navigate around.
