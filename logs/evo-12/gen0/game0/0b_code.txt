To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll design a simple puzzle where the player must navigate a maze-like environment to reach a goal while pushing blocks that can block or assist their path. This game will involve the player pushing blocks and avoiding obstacles to reach a designated goal area.

Here's the plan of action for the game design:

1. **Title and Author Information**: Define the game's title and author.
2. **Objects**: Define the visual representation of each object in the game including the player, walls, blocks, and goals.
3. **Legend**: Define shorthand symbols for each object to use in level design.
4. **Collision Layers**: Define which objects can be on top of others.
5. **Rules**: Define the interactions between objects, such as the player pushing blocks.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define what constitutes a win for any level.
7. **Levels**: Create the levels using the symbols defined in the legend.

This game will involve the player pushing crates to clear paths or block obstacles and reaching a specific goal. Let's implement these elements.

### Explanation:

- **Objects**: Defined visual styles for the background, player, walls, crates, and goal areas.
- **Legend**: Created shorthand symbols for referencing objects in level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensured that objects display correctly by defining their layer positions.
- **Rules**: Implemented a rule to allow the player to push crates and aligned crates on goal areas.
- **Win Conditions**: The player must push all crates to cover all goal tiles to win.
- **Levels**: Three example levels are provided, increasing in complexity. The player must push crates to align them with the goals.

This simple design allows players to practice spatial reasoning and strategic planning in navigating obstacles to achieve the goal.
