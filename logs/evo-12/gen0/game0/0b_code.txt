To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll first outline the essential components required for a PuzzleScript game, which include the following:

1. **Title and Metadata**: This includes the game title, author, and other optional metadata like homepages.
2. **Objects**: Define the visual representation, color, and any interaction properties of the game objects.
3. **Legend**: Map symbols used in levels to the objects defined.
4. **Sounds**: Include any sound effects that will occur during the game, though they're optional.
5. **Collision Layers**: Define which objects can collide or move over others.
6. **Rules**: Describe the interaction between objects when certain conditions are met; essentially the game's logic.
7. **Win Condition**: Specify how a player wins or completes a level.
8. **Levels**: Design grid-based levels that use the legend to map objects onto the grid.

Given these components, I'll create a simple Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player pushes boxes into designated spots. Let's call the game "Pushbox Puzzle":

This game fits within the classic Sokoban genre, where the player maneuvers the player character to push boxes onto target spots. Each level increases in complexity to challenge the player's problem-solving skills.
