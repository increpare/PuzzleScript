The errors presented in the console output relate to a few specific issues in the PuzzleScript code:

1. **Sound Declaration and Rule Mismatch Errors:**
   - At line 67, there's an issue with sound declaration which needs to match the keyword requirements.
   - The rules on lines 85 and 86 are not correctly matched in pattern length, which means the left and right sides of the substitution must cover the same number of cells.

2. **Level Rectangularity Error:**
   - Lines 102 to 105 indicate that the levels defined are not rectangular. Each row in a level map must be the same length for the engine to parse it correctly.

### Plan of Action:
1. **Sound Declaration:** Ensure that any undefined sound-related line is handled or removed if sounds are not needed. It seems the code declares no sound needed, possibly removing the sound-related section might resolve the issue.
   
2. **Adjust Rules:** Make sure that every rule has equal length patterns on both the left and right sides.

3. **Rectangular Levels:** Edit the level definitions to ensure all rows have the same number of characters.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

### Explanation:
- **Rules Correction:** Adjusted the rules to ensure they have the same pattern length on both sides. Specifically, the rules for interacting with BoxOnTarget were made to ensure continuity.
  
- **Levels Corrected:** All levels have been ensured to be rectangular by matching the maximum row length within each level.

This should resolve the errors and let the game compile and function correctly.
