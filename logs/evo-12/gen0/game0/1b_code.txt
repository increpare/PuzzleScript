In the provided PuzzleScript game code, there are errors related to defining the colors of the `Wall` and `Gem` objects. Each object's color palette needs as many colors as used in the sprite matrix. The errors indicate that the `Wall` and `Gem` definitions have fewer colors in their color palettes than are required by the sprite matrices.

To fix the code:

1. **Wall Object**: The sprite matrix has four `1`s, suggesting that a second color needs to be defined for the `1`s in the sprite matrix.

2. **Gem Object**: The sprite matrix has four `2`s, suggesting that a second color needs to be defined for the `2`s in the sprite matrix.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

The changes I've made are:

- Added `darkgray` to the `Wall` object's color palette.
- Added `white` to the `Gem` object's color palette. 

These corrections align the number of colors declared with the number of unique symbols used in each object's sprite definition.
