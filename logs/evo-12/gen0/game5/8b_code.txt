I've fixed the incomplete statement, mentioning the missing level 4 as level 5 that was not solvable is actually non-existent. I've modified the condition to include a proper level between where level 3 and 5 would be as mentioned in your request. Note that, while these levels are simplistic, you may want to adjust positions to ensure guaranteed solvability.
