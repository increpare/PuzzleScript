The errors in the code are due to the presence of a rule that references a nonexistent object, "Crate". Additionally, the rule is improperly structured because its left and right patterns do not have an equal number of cells.

Upon examining the code, this rule might have been intended to handle interactions with stars. However, the "Star" object is already handled correctly with the rule `[ Player | > Star ] -> [ > Player | Star ]`. Therefore, we need to remove the incorrect rule entirely.

To fix the errors, I will:
1. Remove the rule `[ Player | Crate | ] -> [ Player | > Crate ]`.
2. Ensure that the remaining rules and game logic are coherent given the context.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

With these changes, the errors should be resolved, and the game should function as expected.
