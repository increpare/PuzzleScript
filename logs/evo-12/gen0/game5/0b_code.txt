To design a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to create a game with the following components: title, objects, legend, sounds, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. For inspiration, I will create a game where the player must push boulders into target spots on a grid, loosely similar to a simple sokoban-style game.

### Plan of Action:
1. **Title and Author**: Set the title of the game and the author name.
2. **Objects**: Define the visual representation and colors for the game objects: Player, Boulder, Target, Wall, and Background.
3. **Legend**: Create symbols representing each object in the code for easier reference.
4. **Sounds**: Define any sounds that will play during the game (optional).
5. **Collision Layers**: Specify which objects can or cannot coexist in the same space.
6. **Rules**: Implement the rules governing the player and bolder interactions.
7. **Win Conditions**: Set conditions required for winning the level.
8. **Levels**: Design a few simple levels to demonstrate the game mechanics.

Here's the complete code:

### Game Explanation:
- **Objects**: The game consists of walls, a player, boulders, targets, and backgrounds.
- **Rules**: The player can push boulders onto empty spaces or targets, but cannot move through walls.
- **Win Conditions**: The player wins when all boulders are placed on targets.
- **Levels**: Start with a simple level and gradually increase complexity by adding more boulders and targets.

This design outlines a simple and engaging game with multiple levels to challenge users' puzzle-solving abilities.
