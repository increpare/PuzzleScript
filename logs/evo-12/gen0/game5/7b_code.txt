Certainly! Let's address the solvability issue for Level 3 by ensuring that all boulders can be pushed onto their targets without any being stuck. It appears that the arrangement or the number of elements in Level 3 may be making it unsolvable. Here's an adjusted version of the game code with an updated Level 3:

In this updated Level 3, I've rearranged the boulders and targets to ensure it's solvable. The boulders should have a clear path to reach all targets, without being obstructed or surrounded by walls. Feel free to adjust the configuration further if needed.
