Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the rules and the layout of the level don't currently allow the player to move at all, making it impossible to solve the level. Let's update the gameplay rules so that the player can move around. Here's the updated code:

In this updated version, I've added rules for the player to be able to move in the grid. Adjust the rules as you like to further refine player interactions with Stars or any new objects you introduce. Remember, you need logic that describes how and where the player can move, especially if there are Stars that they can interact with or push.
