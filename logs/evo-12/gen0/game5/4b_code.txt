To make the level solvable, ensure that there is a clear path for moving the crate onto the target. For instance, if the player is blocked from effectively pushing the crate onto the target, or if the walls are not configured correctly, it could make the puzzle unsolvable. Here's a possible corrected level:

```plaintext
######
#....#
#..*.#
#..T.#
#..P.#
######
```

Make sure this change allows the player to push the crate directly onto the target without being obstructed by any walls.
