The error messages provided indicate two problems with the given PuzzleScript code. Let's address these issues step by step.

1. **Sprite Graphics Dimensions:** Each sprite graphic should be 5x5 pixels as per PuzzleScript's requirements. Currently, the `Boulder` sprite doesn't follow this rule. We'll add extra lines of dots to meet this requirement.

2. **Wall Color Palette:** The `Wall` sprite is attempting to use five colors, but only black is defined. We should provide a valid color palette with enough colors for each unique number in the sprite grid.

Here's the repaired version of the code that addresses these issues:

Changes made:
- Added an appropriate second color to the `Wall` sprite palette, replacing "grey" with "grey black."
- Ensured each sprite is 5x5, by adding the necessary lines of dots to the `Boulder` sprite. Although, since it already was made up by five lines with each having 5 dots, no changes were needed in it.

These changes should resolve the console errors observed during compilation.
