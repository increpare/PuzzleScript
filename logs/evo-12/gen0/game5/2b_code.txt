Based on the errors we've received, let's break down our tasks:

1. **Color Comment Error**: In PuzzleScript, comments are a way to add notes to your code but need to be on a separate line or after a complete definition, not in the middle of object definitions. Currently, the comment `// Adding a second color to meet the requirement` is incorrectly placed. We should either remove the comment or place it appropriately. Remember, a color definition should be provided directly and should look like `grey black` without unnecessary notes intervening the definition of an object's color.

2. **Sprite Dimensions**: The sprite representation must be exactly 5 characters wide and 5 characters high. The `Boulder` sprite is currently set to 4x4. We need to adjust its graphics to meet the 5x5 requirement.

Here's the corrected code:

Changes Made:
- Removed the in-line comment in the `Wall` object definition.
- Made the `Boulder` sprite correctly 5x5 by filling in the necessary dimensions with periods for transparency.
- Revalidated other sprites just to confirm their 5x5 compliance and adjusted as needed.
  
These changes address the identified compilation errors.
