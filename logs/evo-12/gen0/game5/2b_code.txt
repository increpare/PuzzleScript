To fix the error "Movements cannot appear in late rules", we need to change the rule type. The game code has a late rule with movement symbols, which is not allowed in PuzzleScript. We need to convert the rule into a standard rule if it involves any movement.

Additionally, the original rule in question seems to add the Target property to a Crate when it reaches it, but given this is a Sokoban-style puzzle game (as suggested by the mechanics), we do not necessarily need this and can simplify the interactions.

Here, we'll remove the delay caused by the "late" keyword while maintaining the logical intent: detecting when a crate is on a target. We'll adjust how the rule is structured instead to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version:

In this code:
- The line `[ Crate | Target ] -> [ Crate Crate ]` ensures that the crate is recognized on the target, which is functionally equivalent given the collision layers allow for overlap. However, this rule isn't strictly necessary for functionality, but retains the crate overlay on Target without needing transformations.
- The rule type change fixes the issue raised in the error, adhering to PuzzleScript limitations.
