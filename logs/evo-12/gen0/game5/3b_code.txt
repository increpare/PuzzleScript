The error message you're seeing indicates that there is a mismatch in the length of the patterns on the left and right sides of the rule at line 78. In PuzzleScript rules, each pattern on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right, with both patterns having the same number of entries.

The problematic rule in this game is:
```plaintext
[ Crate | Target ] -> [ Crate Crate ]
```

This rule's left side has two distinct objects (`Crate` and `Target`) and the right side has two `Crate` objects, which is not a one-to-one mapping. The intended rule seems to be attempting to change a Crate on a Target into a concatenated/mirrored form of `Crate`, which does not make sense in the context of PuzzleScript.

The rule needs to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between the left and right patterns. However, if the intention was to change the Crate into some other object when it is on a Target, the rule should maintain only one object on the right or properly replace the Crate.

Let's resolve this by correcting the erroneous rule. Assuming the intention was to simply ensure Crate moves onto Targets are appropriately registered for the win conditions, we can remove this line entirely, as the win condition already ensures the player needs to move a Crate onto a Target.

Here's the corrected code:
