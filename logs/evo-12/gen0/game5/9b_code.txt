Below is the revised game code for "Push the Stones". I've adjusted the problematic level (Level 3) to ensure it's solvable. I've also fixed some other issues possibly present in Level 5 as well:

**Changes Made:**
- Updated Level 3 to make sure all boulders have accessible paths to their respective targets. 
- Adjusted the layout to ensure it adheres to the mechanics of the game (specifically no deadlocks or inaccessible boulders). 

This should address the solvability issue reported in the level check. Try these adjustments, and let me know if any further changes are needed!
