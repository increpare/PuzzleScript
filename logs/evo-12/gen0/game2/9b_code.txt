To address the issues reported in the console output, we'll need to fix several errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code.

1. **Color Syntax Issue**:
    - The error about the color specification for the `Key` object means that there is an extraneous space after "cyan". We'll remove that space to correct it.

2. **Legend Syntax**:
    - The messages regarding keys "L", "V", and "1" indicate there are potentially extra or missing definitions in the `LEGEND` section. Investigating further, these errors seem to be coming from the levels not matching expected symbols in the legend provided. No specific issues were found with parts of the legend.

3. **Level Rectangle Errors**:
    - Lines 115-126 reported maps not being rectangular. This seems to result from lines not having equal lengths among the symbols. We'll ensure that all rows in a level are the same length.

After identifying these issues, we'll proceed with the corrections:

- Remove the extraneous space in the `Key` color definition.
- Normalize row lengths in both levels to ensure they are rectangular.
- Due to the detailed feedback on incorrect keys (`L`, `V`, `1`), ensure no syntax discrepancies for all level elements, matching the legend provided.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
