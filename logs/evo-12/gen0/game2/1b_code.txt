To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Color Error in Objects**: The console output indicates that the color for the `Key` object is not recognized due to a space. Ensure the colors are valid by fixing the textual representation for colors.

2. **Map Rectangularity**: The maps must be rectangular, meaning all lines must be of equal length. Check the level layout for the correct dimensions and fix any disparities.

3. **Undefined Legend Keys (`L`, `V`, and `1`)**: These undefined keys likely arise from erroneous level layout characters or the code attempting to match patterns of the incorrect length due to improper map formatting.

4. **Check and Expand Legend**: Add missing legend definitions if any symbols in the map are not defined.

After analyzing the issues, here's the repaired version of the game code:

### Key Updates Made:

- **Colors**: Confirmed that color for `Key` is corrected by ensuring no spaces or incorrect specifications.
- **Map Rectangularity**: Made sure all rows in the level definitions are of equal length (8 characters wide based on the provided sample).
- **Level Definitions**: Fixed errors within level configurations ensuring all rows are of equal lengths.
- **Legend**: No new legend definitions needed as all level symbols are covered by existing definitions.
