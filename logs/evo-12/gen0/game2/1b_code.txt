To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that the colors referenced in the sprite definitions align with the number of colors actually defined in the respective OBJECT blocks.

The errors found pertain to:
1. The `Player` object attempts to use a third color (color number 3) which is not defined in its palette.
2. The `Target` object also tries to use a third color (color number 2) which is not defined.

The solution involves:
1. Adjusting the `Player` object's color palette to include a third color or modifying the sprite design to use only the available colors.
2. Adjusting the `Target` object's color palette to include a third color or altering the sprite design to use only the defined colors.

After analyzing these, I'll provide a fixed version of the code with appropriate adjustments.

In this solution:
- The `Player` object now has a third color `Red`, which was originally missing, to correspond to color reference '3'.
- The `Target` object now includes a third color `DarkGreen`, which resolves the missing reference to color '2'.
