To resolve the compilation errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the issues related to color palette definitions for the `Background` and `Wall` objects. Here's an analysis of the situation:

1. Each sprite's color palette is defined by a set of color values listed after the sprite's name. The game code seems to be specifying multicolor sprites (e.g., `Background` and `Wall`) but is only defined with a single color.
2. Each sprite pattern line (e.g., `11111`) references color numbers from these defined color sets. For example, a `1` would refer to the first color, `2` to the second color, etc. The error indicates a mismatch between the number of colors defined and what’s being referenced.

Since the code is attempting to reference color number 1 for the `Background` and `Wall`, which actually expects more than one color based on standard practices and given pattern lengths, we need to redefine these objects with the correct number of colors. 

After understanding the required adjustments, here’s the repaired version of the code:

In this corrected version, I fixed the color palette for `Background` and `Wall` by specifying the correct number of colors. This should eliminate the compilation errors related to color references.
