RULES
======
[Saved] [Goal] -> [] [HasSavedDoor] (Remembering whether we saved someone last round by temporarily changing some door to a HasSavedDoor. This is purely for sound effects purposes.)

[Corpse] -> Restart

[ >  Fighter | Moveable ] -> [  >  Fighter | > Moveable  ]
[ > Moveable | Moveable ] [ Fighter] -> [ > Moveable | > Moveable ] [ Fighter] (Fighters push.)

[ < Thief | Moveable ] -> [ < Thief | < Moveable ] (Thieves pull.)

[ > Wizard ] -> [ Wizard > Warpball]
[ > Warpball | no Moveable no Static] -> [ | > Warpball]
[ > Warpball | Static] [Wizard] -> [ | Static ] [> Wizard]
[ > Warpball | Moveable ] [Wizard] -> [ | Wizard Sfx0] [Moveable]
[ > Warpball] [Wizard] -> [] [> Wizard]
(Wizards telexport. What they really do is shoot a "warpball", which causes them to move normally if it hits a wall or the edge of the screen and warp if it hits something they can warp with.)

(Druid does his thing. Warpball gets reused as a placeholder here. That's gonna happen a lot.)
[> Druid | Crate] -> [Druid | Wall Sfx8]
[> Druid | Monster] -> [Druid | Wall Sfx8]
[> Druid | Wall] -> [Druid | Crate Sfx8]
[> Druid | Healer] -> [Druid | Healer Saved]
[> Druid | Hero] -> [Druid | Hero Warpball]
[Warpball | Healer] -> [Saved | Healer]
[Warpball Hero] -> [Wall Sfx8]
(What strategic purpose could it serve for healers to protect against petrification? None, but it's fun.)

(I mean, theoretically you could write some horrid dragon breath timing puzzle where the ability to delay an extra turn without moving or switching characters is necessary in order to let you move someone else at the correct moment, but even if dragons still existed, that sounds like a really gross level.)

(Bard moves stuff. Reusing "WarpBall" for totally different purpose, so we can cancel the move if he doesn't move.)
[> Bard no Note] -> [> Note > Bard WarpBall]
[> Note] [Note] -> [> Note] [> Note]
[> Note Moveable | no Static no Moveable no Bard] -> [| Moveable Sfx7]
+[> Note Bard WarpBall| no Static no Moveable no Bard] -> [| Bard]

(Why are we doing this pseudo-movement instead of using the built-in version? Because using movement directions makes the note-adding stuff way easier below, and you can't use movement directions in the LATE phase, so the actual moving has to be done before then.)

[WarpBall] -> Cancel
[Note] -> []

(The following mess is for changing characters. But at least it's less messy than before. Thanks to Stephen for spotting my silly redundancies.)

[ Action Bard] [SPriest] -> [SBard] [Priest Sfx1]
[ Action Druid] [SBard] -> [SDruid] [Bard Sfx1]

(Bard plays music. This is my favorite part of the code, btw. Yes, you can make square area effects with just one object!)
[no Note | no Note | Bard] -> [^ Note | ^ Note | Bard]
[no Note | Bard] -> [^ Note | Bard]
[> Note | no Note | no Note] -> [Note | Note | Note]
[> Note | no Note] -> [Note | Note]
[> Note] -> [Note]

(Now enemies attack. Yeah, there's only one kind of enemy now.)

Late [Goblin | Vulnerable] -> [Goblin | Dying Vulnerable]

(Vulnerable objects that are attacked are designated as "Dying", but heroes can be saved by the Priest. Then the stuff that didn't get saved dies.)

Late [Dying Healer] -> [Saved Healer]
Late [Healer | Dying Hero] -> [Healer | Saved Hero]
Late [Dying Monster] -> [Sfx5]
Late [Dying Hero] -> [Corpse Sfx6]

(Doors opening.)

late [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor] -> [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [YellowOpen] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor sfx2]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowOpen sfx3]

late [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor] -> [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [PurpleOpen] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor sfx2]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleOpen sfx3]

late [MonsterDoor] -> [ShadowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] [Monster] -> [MonsterDoor] [Monster]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [sfx3]

(Looks for a HasSavedDoor and, if there is one, puts a warpball on the Priest. Then, if someone was saved this turn, plays the sound only if the Priest doesn't have the warpball. Finally, cleans that up.)

late [HasSavedDoor] [Healer] -> [Goal] [Healer WarpBall]
late [Saved] [Healer no WarpBall] -> [Saved sfx4] [Healer]
late [HasSavedDoor] -> [Goal]
late [WarpBall] -> []
