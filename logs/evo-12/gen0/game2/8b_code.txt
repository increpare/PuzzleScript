To fix the solvability issue with Level 2, you should ensure that the positions of the Player, Block, and Target are aligned in such a way that allows the Player to push the Block onto the Target without being obstructed by Walls or other Blocks. Here's a suggestion for a solvable Level 2 configuration:

Replace the Level 2 configuration with the following:

```plaintext
###### 
#....#
#.P*.#
#..#O#
#.O..#
###### 
```

This modification should make the level solvable. The Player can reach and push the Block onto the Target without being blocked by Walls.
