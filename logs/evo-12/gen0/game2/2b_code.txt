To address the errors reported in the PuzzleScript game code, let's go through the issues and then provide the corrected version of the code:

1. **Color Parsing Error**: The console output indicated an issue with the definition of the color for `Key`. The extra space in "Cyan " has likely caused this error. We need to remove any trailing spaces.

2. **Unrecognized Characters**: Errors regarding unrecognized keys such as "L", "V", and "1" indicate potential issues within the `LEGEND` section or level layouts. Ensure all characters in the levels are defined in the `LEGEND`.

3. **Level Rectangularity**: Several lines mention that levels have to be rectangular, meaning every row in a level must have the same number of columns. We need to ensure that all levels provided have rows of equal length.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

**Corrections Overview**:

- Removed trailing space from the `Key` color definition.
- Ensured all symbols and characters used in levels are defined in the `LEGEND`.
- Ensured levels are rectangular by adjusting any lines that were shorter or longer than others. In Level 1, amended the length of some lines to ensure uniformity.

This should address the errors reported during compilation, allowing the game to run as intended.
