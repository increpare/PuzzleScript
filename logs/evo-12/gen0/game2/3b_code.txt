To address the issues in the PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the errors and figure out the best approach for fixing them:

1. **Color Error in Key Object:** The console error indicates that there's an issue with the color definition for the "Key" object. It looks like there is an unintended space after "Cyan". The color names should be specified without trailing spaces.

2. **Legend Issues:** There are missing keys in the legend (probably 'L', 'V', and '1'). This error stems from the level maps where there are undefined or unrecognized characters present. We need to ensure each character in the level maps is defined in the legend section.

3. **Map Rectangularity:** The level maps must be rectangular, meaning each row should have the same number of characters. The discrepancy errors suggest that your level maps are not rectangular. We need to check and ensure that each row within a level has consistent length.

Taking these into consideration, let's correct the game code:

**Key Points:**
- Removed any trailing spaces from color definitions.
- Ensured that each character in the level is defined in the legend.
- Verified each row in the level maps has the same length, making them rectangular.
