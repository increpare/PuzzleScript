To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code and ensure it compiles correctly, here is the approach to take:

1. **Fix the Key Object Color Issue**: The error message points out that "cyan " (with a trailing space) is not recognized. Make sure to remove any trailing spaces in the color definition.

2. **Correct Legend and Object Definitions**: Check that every object and symbol used in levels is defined in the LEGEND section and that their syntax is correct. There was no mention of "L" or "V" or "1" in the original setup, so confirm there are no characters present in the level layout that are not in the LEGEND.

3. **Rectangular Level Layout**: Ensure that all rows in each level have the same length, making sure your levels are rectangular by adjusting the characters in each row.

4. **Fix the Crate, Goal, and Door Rules**: Although not directly pointed out by the errors, review rules for semantic consistency.

Bring these insights together to revise the game code as follows:
