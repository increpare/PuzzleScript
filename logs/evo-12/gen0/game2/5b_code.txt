To repair the code, we need to address the compilation errors that were pointed out:

1. **Maps must be rectangular**: Each row in a level must be the same length. This error indicates a mismatch in the number of characters for the rows in the level maps provided. We'll inspect each level and make sure every row is the same length. 

2. **Pattern Matching Error in Rules**: In the rules section, the patterns defined on the left side of the rule must have a corresponding pattern of equal length on the right side. This ensures that the transformation for the player and block is happening uniformly across the grid.

### Action Plan
- Ensure each level has rows of equal length by checking each level map.
- Ensure the rule definitions match in terms of pattern length on both sides of the transformation.

### Changes made:
- **Level Corrections:** Adjusted the rows in the third level where an extra column was missing (it looks like a character was omitted in the level definition).
- **Rule Corrections:** Explicitly added the third pattern slot (`| `) on the right-hand side of the rule for uniform transformation.
