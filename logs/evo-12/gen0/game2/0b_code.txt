To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I must define several components including the title, author, and objects used in the game. Next, I will establish the legend, sounds, collision layers, rules, and win conditions to guide the gameplay. Lastly, I'll design a few levels to demonstrate the mechanics and objectives of the game. The game will be a simple block-pushing puzzle, where the player needs to push crates to specific target locations to win.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I will structure the game:

1. **Title and Metadata**: Define the game's title, author, and any additional metadata.
2. **Objects**: Create the visual representation of game elements such as Background, Player, Wall, Crate, and Target.
3. **Legend**: Assign shorthand symbols to represent the objects within the level maps.
4. **Sounds**: Declare sounds for specific game actions (optional, focus on crate movement).
5. **Collision Layers**: Specify how objects interact or stack, ensuring a logical layer setup for movement.
6. **Rules**: Define how the player interacts with the environment, including moving crates.
7. **Win Conditions**: Set the conditions required to win a level, such as all crates must be on targets.
8. **Levels**: Create multiple levels to showcase game mechanics.

Hereâ€™s the complete code for the PuzzleScript game:

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Objects**: Defined with a simple representation, including colors to distinguish each object.
- **Legend**: Provides shorthand for defining levels more succinctly.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensures objects like the player and crates are on a lower layer than the background.
- **Rules**: Includes fundamental interactions such as pushing crates and the transformation of a crate on a target.
- **Win Conditions**: Ensures players complete the objective by moving all crates onto the targets.
- **Levels**: Range in difficulty to provide a balanced experience as players learn the mechanics.

This sample code offers a simple yet complete experience within the PuzzleScript framework, demonstrating the essential features of a block-pushing puzzle game.
