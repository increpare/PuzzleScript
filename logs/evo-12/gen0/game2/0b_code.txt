To make the games "Block Pusher Adventure" and "Maze Runner" more complex, I'll merge elements of both games into a single, cohesive game. The new game will include:

1. **Complex Mechanic Integration**: Combine crate pushing and key collection.
2. **Multi-Level Objectives**: Require the player to place crates on goals and collect keys to unlock exits.
3. **Additional Game Elements**: Introduce a door object that requires keys to open.
4. **Level Design**: Craft levels that leverage these mechanics to provide more challenging puzzles.

The new game, "Key & Crate Challenge", will maintain separate objective layers: one for crates and goals, and another for keys and exits. Here's how you might implement this:

### Explanation:
- **Game Goals**: The player must push crates onto goals, collect keys, open doors, and reach exits.
- **Multi-Phase Objectives**: Players need to interact with various elements iteratively: solve puzzles to get keys, open doors, then proceed to solve crate placement puzzles.
- **Progression**: Different levels will introduce new complexities in terms of the layout and interaction of these elements.
- **Mechanics**: The player can push crates only if a path is clear. Upon collection of a key (`Key`), doors (`Door`) open, providing access to new areas and the exit. Crates must be positioned correctly on goals before exiting to win a level.

This variation makes the game more complex and engaging, combining the mechanics of both original games and creating multiple layers of interaction for the player.
