(While we allow whales to move onto the void, player's aren't)
[ > player | void ] -> [ player | void ] 

(Beams detect motion)
horizontal [ > Player | VBeam ] -> [ > Player | > VBeam ] 
vertical [ > Player | HBeam ] -> [ > Player | > HBeam ] 

(If beams detected motion, transfer that to the whales)
[ Whale | ... | perpendicular Beam ] -> [ perpendicular Whale | ... | perpendicular Beam ] 

(Remove whales, if necessary)
late [ Whale Void ] -> [ Void ] 

(Remove beams)
[ Beam ] -> [ ] 

(Place HVeams and VBeams)
late horizontal [ Whale | ... | ] -> [ Whale | ... | HBeam ]
