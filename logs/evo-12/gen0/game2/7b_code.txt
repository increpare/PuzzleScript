To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to focus on the following issues:

1. **Color Specification Error for Key**: There is an unwanted space in the color specification for the `Key` object. We need to remove the space from "cyan ".

2. **Incorrect Comment Syntax**: Comments in PuzzleScript are indicated by using semicolons (`;`), but in the code, comments are written using `//`, which is invalid in this context. We need to replace `//` with `;`.

Once we fix these errors, the code should compile correctly. Let's proceed with these corrections:

Above, the color error for the `Key` object has been fixed by removing the extra space in "Cyan", and comments have been adjusted to use `;` for proper PuzzleScript comment syntax. This should resolve all previously mentioned issues.
