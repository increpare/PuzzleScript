Let's analyze the given errors and determine the necessary fixes:

1. **Color Parsing Error**: The error on line 49 indicates there was an issue parsing the color for the `Key` object. The issue is with the extra space at the end of "Cyan ". We'll remove the extra space.

2. **Legend and Key Issues**: The errors about keys "L", "V", and "1" not being found indicate that the level configuration is misplaced or not correctly defined in the legend. Instead of interpreting "Level 1" and "Level 2" as part of the level design, they're misinterpreted as part of the map.

3. **Level Maps are not Rectangular**: The levels need all rows and columns to be the same length. We'll ensure each row in the level map has the same number of tiles.

4. **Adjust the WINCONDITIONS**: The current win conditions expect crates to be on goals and the player to be on an exit without any doors. We need to ensure the level layouts allow these conditions to be met. We'll place goals and crates in a reasonable configuration.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

### Explanation:

- **Color Parsing**: Removed the trailing space from "Cyan".
- **Legend**: Adapted to ensure characters like `L`, `V`, and `1` weren't misinterpreted; these were due to mislabeling level map rows.
- **Level Dimensions**: Adjusted levels to ensure all rows have the same length.
- **Level Layout**: Ensured each level is properly enclosed and symmetric/consistent with the rules. Adjust both levels to have manageable paths for the player to achieve the goal conditions.
