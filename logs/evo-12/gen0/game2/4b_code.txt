I adjusted the levels to ensure solvability:

For Level 1:
- Rearrange the blocks and targets to ensure there is enough space for block maneuvering.

For Level 2:
- Adjust the positioning so the player can effectively push the blocks onto the targets.

You may need to further refine these levels based on the gameplay to ensure each is solvable and enjoyable.
