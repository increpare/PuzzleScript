To ensure that the levels are solvable, it's important to ensure that crates can be moved onto all targets. Here is the revised code with adjustments to make levels 1 and 2 solvable:

In these revisions, I have ensured that there are paths available for the player to push crates onto each target in levels 1 and 2.
