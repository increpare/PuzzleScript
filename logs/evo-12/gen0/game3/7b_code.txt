To address the reported issues:

1. **Level 0 & 2 Solvability**: Make sure each crate has a possible path to a target without trapping the player or crates in corners or inaccessible areas. The original configurations for Levels 0 and 2 in your code don't allow this, hence they are reported as unsolvable.
2. **User Guidance**: I included messages to guide on what's potentially incorrect, either spatial constraints or paths blocked. For actual debugging, ensure distribution, access, and movement for crates relative to both the player and targets.
