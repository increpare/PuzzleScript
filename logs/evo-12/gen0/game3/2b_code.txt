The error you encountered is likely due to issues with the win condition and level design. Let's address these:

1. **Win Condition:** The current win condition `all Target on Crate` may be incorrect. It should probably be `all Crate on Target`.

2. **Levels:** Ensure that each level is designed such that it is possible to move all crates onto target locations.

Below is a revised version of your code with these corrections:

### Key Changes:
- **Win Conditions:** Changed from `all Target on Crate` to `all Crate on Target`.
- **Levels:** Adjusted the second and third levels to ensure they are solvable, moving walls and obstacles to allow the player to push crates onto targets.

Make sure that each level is possible by ensuring enough space and accessible paths for the player to move crates onto all target locations. Adjust the level designs further if you find them still unsolvable during testing.
