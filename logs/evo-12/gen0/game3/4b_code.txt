The error message indicates an issue with the color specification for the "Background" object. In PuzzleScript, object colors are specified in a format recognized by the language, typically using hexadecimal color codes.

Currently, the game code uses "deepskyblue white" for the Background object, which seems to not be properly recognized by PuzzleScript. I'll replace these colors with a simple pair of hexadecimal color values for clarity, and ensure that they are written in the format PuzzleScript expects.

Changes made:
- Replaced the color names "deepskyblue" and "white" for the Background with appropriate hexadecimal color codes `#00BFFF` and `#FFFFFF`.
- Ensured all objects have colors specified in a valid hexadecimal format recognized by PuzzleScript.
