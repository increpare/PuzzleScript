To resolve the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code and ensure it compiles without errors, several corrections need to be made:

1. **Sprite Matrix Error for `Trap`:** 
   - The error message indicates an issue with the `Trap` object's sprite matrix. The matrix for each object must be exactly 5x5. Adjust the matrix for `Trap` to fulfill this requirement.

2. **Sprite Size Error:**
   - `Trap` and `TrapDisabled` had matrices smaller than required. We'll adjust these to ensure they are 5x5, using periods (`.`) to fill empty spaces.

3. **Pattern Length Mismatch in Rules:**
   - The rules reported as problematic involve patterns where the left and right sides of a rule must have an equal number of pattern cells. We'll ensure that each part of these rules matches accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Changes:
- **`Trap` and `TrapDisabled` sprites:**
  - Adjusted to ensure they are 5 lines tall, each with 5 characters. Added `.` to fill the grid properly.
  
- **Patterns in rules:**
  - Adjusted mismatched patterns errors in rules to ensure both sides have an equal number of pattern cells by removing extraneous elements.

- These changes correct the issues without altering the game logic beyond fixing compile errors. If specific game behaviors are intended that aren't met with these changes, further testing and adjustment might be needed.
