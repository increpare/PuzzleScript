To make this "Pushbox Puzzle" game more complex, I will introduce a few new elements and mechanics:

1. **New Object - Obstacle**: This will be an object that can be moved only when a Box is pushed into it.
   
2. **New Mechanic - Trap**: If a Player steps on this trap, it returns to the starting position. Traps can be disabled by pushing a Box over them.
   
3. **Multiple Players/Characters**: Introduce a second player character with collaborative puzzle solving in mind. The two must cooperate to solve levels, adding a layer of complexity.

4. **Revised Levels**: Create levels that use the new obstacles and traps to increase difficulty.

Here's the code:

### Explanation:
- **Player2 (Q)**: A second player is introduced to collaborate with the first player.
- **Obstacle (O)**: Can only be moved when a Box is pushed into it, adding new dimensions to how space and paths are managed.
- **Trap (@)**: Triggers a restart if the player steps on it. Can be neutralized by moving a Box over it, turning it into a TrapDisabled (D).
- **New Win Condition**: The game still requires all boxes to be on target spots, but now with more complexity through traps and interactions between two players.

These new elements and mechanisms force players to think strategically with both player characters, manage routes effectively, and safely handle traps, creating a much more challenging experience.
