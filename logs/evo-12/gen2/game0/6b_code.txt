The errors in the PuzzleScript code are due to the presence of comments incorrectly placed at the end of rules. PuzzleScript doesn't support inline comments like some programming languages do. Comments in PuzzleScript must be placed on their own lines and start with a semicolon (`;`). Additionally, there were some inconsistencies with indentation, which I've also tidied up.

Here's a repaired version of the game code with the correct comments implemented:

This version ensures that the comments are placed correctly and the rules are interpreted properly by the PuzzleScript engine.
