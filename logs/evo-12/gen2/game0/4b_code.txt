To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to analyze each of the error messages and provide corresponding fixes.

1. **line 72 & line 68**: These lines refer to issues with the `Trap` object. Specifically, the sprite graphics are not 5x5 and there's an additional character "X". We need to adjust this to fit the 5x5 requirement by removing the additional pieces outside the boundaries.

2. **line 126 & line 132**: These lines suggest that the rule patterns do not have corresponding elements on both the left and right sides. We need to ensure that each side of the rule has the same number of cells.

With this understanding, I'll provide the corrected code below:

**Key Corrections**:
- The `Trap` sprite now conforms to a 5x5 grid with only valid characters.
- The rules for `[ X | T ]` have been updated to ensure symmetry on both sides of the rule, with matched pairs in length.
