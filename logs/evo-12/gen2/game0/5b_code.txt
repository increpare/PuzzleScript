To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to correct the rules that are causing the compilation errors. The error messages indicate that some rules do not have matching patterns on both sides of the rule. Specifically, the number of cells on the left side of the rule does not correspond with the right side.

Let's examine the problematic rules:
1. **Line 126**: `[ X | T ] -> [ B | T ]`
   - Here, the number of cells on both sides should be the same. We see that both sides indeed have two objects (`X` and `T` on the left and `B` and `T` on the right), so the error message might be indicating a redundancy that we can simplify by changing how boxes become marked on targets.
  
2. **Line 132**: `[ B | @ ] -> [ D ]`
   - The left side of the rule has two objects (`B` and `@`), while the right side has one object (`D`). We need to restructure this to match cell counts.

Correction Steps:
- The rule at line 126 seems to handle when `BoxOnTarget` (`X`) is on a `Target` (`T`), though semantically, this combination should not change to just `Box`. Instead, `Box` when on `Target` turns into `BoxOnTarget`. Thus, we might not need this redundancy.
- For line 132, we need to ensure the replacement has two objects as well, or modify the game logic to handle replacing just `@` with `D`.

Here is the fixed version of the PuzzleScript code:

In this revision, we've made sure that the left and right sides of the rules are correctly matching in terms of cell count, which addresses the errors reported by the compiler.
