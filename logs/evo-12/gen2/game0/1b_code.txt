To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the task and fix each issue:

1. **Sprite Size Error (Trap):**
   - The error indicates that the sprite for `Trap` is not of the correct size (5x5). It seems there are extra characters (`XX`) present, making it only two columns wide instead of five. We'll fix this by ensuring it is a 5x5 sprite.

2. **Pattern Length Mismatch Errors:**
   - Two rules were flagged for having mismatched pattern lengths. This means the number of objects in the left pattern doesn't correspond to the number on the right, resulting in a logical error. We'll ensure that the rules maintain symmetry between the left and right patterns.

Let's review and fix these issues in the code:

**Key Fixes Made:**
- **Trap Sprite:** Modified the sprite to ensure it is 5x5 in size.
- **Rule Patterns:** Ensured that each rule has matched numbers of cells on both sides of the arrow according to what each rule logically represents, fixing mismatches.
- **Space Usage:** Made sure no extra spaces were used that could induce errors.

This corrected code should compile without errors and behave as expected.
