To address the issues in the code, we need to:

1. Fix errors in the sprite matrix of the `Trap` object:
   - Ensure that each sprite matrix is 5x5. The error indicates that the `Trap` object's sprite matrix was not correctly specified as 5x5, but had only 3x3 of design ('..XX.\n..XX.\n').

2. Address the rules with mismatched pattern lengths:
   - In PuzzleScript, the rules must have a matching number of items (cells) on the left and right sides. The rules [ X no T ] -> [ B ] and [ X | P ] -> [ X | P ] are inconsistent because the right side is missing the corresponding states for patterns not involving `T` or `P`.

Here's the corrected code with these changes:

### Explanation:
- Modified the sprite matrix for the `Trap` object to ensure it's 5x5 in size, padding it with dots ('.') to fill the matrix correctly.
- Adjusted rule `[ X no T ] -> [ B ]` by changing it to `[ X T ] -> [ B T ]` to address the length mismatch.
- Similarly, other related rules have been revised to ensure they align properly in terms of left and right pattern lengths.
