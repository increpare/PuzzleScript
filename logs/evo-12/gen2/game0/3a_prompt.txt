(Move connections along with the crates themselves)
[ moving Crate stationary Crate_connection ] -> [ moving Crate moving Crate_connection ]

(If any crate can't move, cancel the turn. This works because there's only one player.)

( ==================
  CLIMBING & GRAVITY
  ================== )

(A player can climb on top of a crate by walking into it or pressing up while facing it, but only if there's something on the other side of the crate so the player can't push it, and also if there's nothing above the player or the crate. Done by using a temporary player object that moves up if there's no obstacle above and then moves on top of the crate if there's no obstacle there.)
RIGHT [ > NonCursorPlayer | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | Crate | Solid ]
RIGHT [ ^ PlayerRight | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | Crate | Solid ]
UP [ PlayerJumpRight | no Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | v PlayerRight ]
LEFT [ > NonCursorPlayer | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | Crate | Solid ]
LEFT [ v PlayerLeft | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | Crate | Solid ]
UP [ PlayerJumpLeft | no Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | ^ PlayerLeft ]

(don't let the player move up or down unless they're on a ladder)
[ UP NonCursorPlayer no Ladder ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer no Ladder ]

(assert gravity)
DOWN [ STATIONARY Crate ] -> [ > Crate ] again
DOWN [ STATIONARY NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | no Ladder ] -> [ > NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | no Ladder ] again

(get keys and unlock goals; happens after gravity so you can fall on keys)
HORIZONTAL DOWN [ > NonCursorPlayer | Key ] [ GoalLocked ] -> [ > NonCursorPlayer | ] [ Goal ] SFX7

(Clean up after jumping.)
(If the player is on top of a temporary jump token, then the player moved up but was blocked by an obstacle on top of the crate, so move the player back down.)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer | PlayerJump ] -> [ | NonCursorPlayer ]
(If the player and the temporary jump token both exist here, then the player jumped successfully. Clear the token and destroy the crumbling floor if the player was standing on one.)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ PlayerJump | Crumble ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ | ] SFX5 SFX2
late [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ PlayerJump ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ ] SFX5
(If there's a temporary jump token remaining here, then the player tried jumping but was blocked from above. Turn the token back into the player.)
late [ PlayerJumpLeft ] -> [ PlayerLeft ]
late [ PlayerJumpRight ] -> [ PlayerRight ]

( {2} )
(Hitting X over one of the arrows in edit mode drops a crate. Search for {1} for an explanation of why this rule is here after gravity.)
DOWN [ DOWN EditModeCursor | no Thing ] -> [ EditModeCursor | Crate ] SFX3 again
[ DOWN EditModeCursor ] -> [ EditModeCursor ]

(win condition; player must be standing on solid ground to enter the goal)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer Goal | Solid ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer Goal | Solid ] SFX0 win

(crumble breakable floors if the player is walking away after standing on one; happens after pushing, climbing, & gravity)
DOWN [ PERPENDICULAR NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | Crumble ] -> [ PERPENDICULAR NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | ] SFX2
