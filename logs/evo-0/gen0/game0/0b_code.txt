To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to follow a structured approach while considering the major components of the game: Objects, Legend, CollisionLayers, Rules, WinConditions, and Levels.

1. **Define Objects**: Start by creating sprites for the background, player, goals, obstacles, and any other interactive elements. Since this is a puzzle game, we can have a simple theme like a Sokoban-style game.

2. **Legend**: Create shorthand symbols to represent these objects which will be used in the game levels.

3. **Collision Layers**: Specify the layers in which these objects will interact. This will define the layer of abstraction and allow certain objects to interact while others do not.

4. **Rules**: Create movement and interaction rules, such as how the player moves and how objects react when pushed or pulled.

5. **Win Conditions**: Define what constitutes a win, such as moving all target objects to specific goal positions.

6. **Level Creation**: Design some levels utilizing the predefined elements.

Now, let's implement the code for our PuzzleScript game:

# Level 1

#..G.#
#..B.#

# Level 2

#..G..#
#..B..#
#..P..#
#######

# Level 3
#######
#..G..#
#..B..#
#..B..#
#..P..#
#######

```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Objects**: We designed simple representations for the background, player, walls, boxes, and goals. Each object has a distinct color.

- **Legend**: We assign characters like `#`, `P`, `B`, and `G` for quick reference in level creation.

- **Collision Layers**: The defined layers prevent certain objects, such as walls, from overlapping with players or boxes, and define which elements can interact.

- **Rules**: Players can move into empty tiles, players can push boxes into empty spots, but players cannot move through walls or stack boxes.

- **Win Conditions**: The win state is achieved when all `Box` objects are positioned on `Goal` objects.

- **Levels**: Three example levels are created, gradually increasing in complexity.

This code should serve as a basic framework for a PuzzleScript game. Players will navigate through levels, pushing boxes onto goals to complete each level.
