The error messages indicate that there's a problem with the color definitions for the `Player` object in the `OBJECTS` section. Specifically, the `Player` object is expecting valid color definitions, but it received something incorrect. To fix this, we need to ensure that each object has a valid color specification according to PuzzleScript's requirements.

Here's the plan of action:
1. Correct the color definition for the `Player` object. The correct format requires specifying a single primary color or up to two colors (primary and secondary) for shading.
2. Review all objects to ensure they follow the PuzzleScript color definition conventions.
3. Ensure the CollisionLayers are correctly defined. Since Walls are part of the game, make sure they are in a collision layer.
4. Check and adjust the rules if necessary, though initially, the rules appear correctly defined.

Based on this analysis, here's a fixed version of the code:

In this corrected code:
- The colors for the `Player` object have been properly defined according to the format required by PuzzleScript.
- Added the `Wall` to the collision layer to prevent objects from passing through it.
- The format for each object follows the conventions set by PuzzleScript, which should resolve the compilation errors.
