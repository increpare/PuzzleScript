To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several key components: objects, their properties and appearance, rules that dictate interactions, winning conditions, and levels where the gameplay takes place. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline to guide the process:

1. **Choose a Theme and Objective**: Define the core theme of the game and the player's objective. For this example, let's create a game called "Forest Escape" where the player navigates through a maze-like forest, avoiding traps and reaching the goal line.

2. **Define Objects**: Decide on the objects the game will have. Include:
   - `Player`: The main character.
   - `Tree`: Represents obstacles.
   - `Exit`: The goal the player must reach.
   - `Trap`: A danger to avoid.

3. **Design Object Appearance and Color**: Each object in the game needs a design and a color for identification.

4. **Set Up Rules**: Create interactions between these objects using rules:
   - The player can move up, down, left, and right.
   - Collisions with traps result in a game over.
   - Reaching the exit results in a win.

5. **Define Win Conditions**: The player wins by reaching the exit.

6. **Create Levels**: Design levels with increasing complexity, incorporating the objects defined.

Here is the complete code for the "Forest Escape" PuzzleScript game:

### Explanation:
- **Title and Author**: Set the game's title and your name as the author.
- **Objects**: Define the player, obstacles (trees), traps (loses if touched), and the exit (win condition).
- **Legend**: Assign symbols for easy reference in levels.
- **Rules**: Define how the player interacts with other objects, especially handling game over scenarios with traps.
- **Win Condition**: The player must reach the exit.
- **Levels**: Create a few levels to enhance gameplay complexity over time, starting simple and adding traps and obstacles.

This game can be expanded by adding more elements, levels, and rules to increase its depth and complexity. Adjust appearance and sounds to make it more engaging.
