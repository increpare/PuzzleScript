To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to fix the following:

1. **Color Error:** The error message indicates there is an issue with the color definition for the Player object. It seems "magenta " (with a trailing space) is causing the problem. Ensure that color definitions are correct and do not have unnecessary spaces.

2. **Undefined Keys in the Legend:** The console output suggests that certain keys ('S', 'I', 'M', 'L', 'N') were not found, meaning they were used in the levels but not defined in the "LEGEND" section. In reviewing the levels, it seems like this might be due to the misinterpretation of a pasting or syntax issue. However, none of these letters appear in the level design. Ensure all used symbols in levels are defined in the LEGEND.

Given the steps above, I'll correct the script by:

- Removing any trailing spaces from the Player object color.
- Verifying that all symbols used in levels are clearly defined in the LEGEND section.
- Ensuring that levels have corresponding definitions in the object and legend parts.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

This version of the code should now avoid the mentioned errors and compile successfully. Each object, color, and symbol is clearly defined, and there should be no extraneous symbols causing errors.
