To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the color issues in the `Player` object definition. The console errors suggest that the `Player` object's color was defined incorrectly. Instead of specifying colors using names like "magenta," we need to use the RGB hexadecimal color code. This code specifies the correct color to be used in the sprite definition. Additionally, ensure every object has properly defined colors in the OBJECTS section.

Here is the fixed version of the code:

Changes made:
1. Replaced color names with hexadecimal color codes:
   - `Player`: `#ff00ff` (magenta)
   - `Tree`: `#006400` (dark green)
   - `Exit`: `#0000ff` (blue)
   - `Trap`: `#ff0000` (red)
   - `Wall`: `#808080` (gray)

2. Made sure the colors match the expected RGB format to comply with the PuzzleScript syntax. This should resolve the color-related errors and ensure the game compiles successfully.
