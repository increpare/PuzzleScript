The errors you're encountering are due to misalignment between the objects defined and their respective colors. I'll correct the code so that it adheres to the expected format in PuzzleScript. I'll ensure that each object is correctly assigned to its corresponding color.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

I've made sure that all defined objects have the correct color assignments, and I've aligned everything with the expectations of the PuzzleScript language. This should resolve the compilation errors you encountered.
