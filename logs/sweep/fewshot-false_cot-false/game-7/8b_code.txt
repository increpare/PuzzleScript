Certainly! The error messages in your code are due to a few issues with the syntax in the `colors` section. Specifically, the colors are assigned to objects using the object name directly as defined in the `legend`, and these should match exactly. Below is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

This corrected version uses the object symbols directly in the `colors` section, matching what you've declared under `objects` in the `legend` section. This should resolve the compilation errors you encountered.
