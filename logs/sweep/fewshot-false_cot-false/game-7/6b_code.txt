Based on the errors reported, it seems that there might be confusion in the "colors" section where object identifiers and color names might not be correctly separated. Additionally, the use of the "homepage" keyword is incorrect and should be placed within a comment if used for descriptive purposes. 

Here is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

Key corrections made in this version:
- The `homepage` definition has been commented as PuzzleScript doesn't have a built-in `homepage` keyword.
- Ensured the colors are correctly defined with object names directly followed by a color.
- Replaced `$` with `B` and `@` with `P` in the level design to align with the object legend definitions.
