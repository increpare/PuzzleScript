Based on the error messages, it seems like there were a few issues with the syntax and order of sections in your PuzzleScript game code. I've corrected these issues in the code below. The sections are now in the correct order, and I've fixed the `require_player_movement` option to its correct form. Additionally, I addressed the references in the `legend` section by ensuring that all objects are properly defined in the `objects` section.

Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

With these corrections, the game should compile without errors. Make sure that sections are in the correct order, and that every object referenced in the `legend` is properly defined in the `objects` section. The option `require_player_movement` does not take any parameters, so simply including it alone is sufficient.
