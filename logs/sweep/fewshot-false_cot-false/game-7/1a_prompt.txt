=================================
line 12 : Unrecognised stuff in the prelude.
line 14 : MetaData REQUIRE_PLAYER_MOVEMENT doesn't take any parameters, but you went and gave it "true".
line 18 : section "LEGEND" is out of order, must follow  "OBJECTS" (or it could be that the section "OBJECTS"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 19 : You're talking about BACKGROUND but it's not defined anywhere.
line 20 : You're talking about WALL but it's not defined anywhere.
line 21 : You're talking about PLAYER but it's not defined anywhere.
line 22 : You're talking about BOX but it's not defined anywhere.
