It seems there are some syntax errors related to the `options`, `colors`, and `levels` sections of your PuzzleScript code. Here is the corrected version:

### Summary of Fixes:
1. **`options` section:** Put `true` after `require_player_movement` to correctly use the option.
2. **`colors` section:** Each color definition must be properly capitalized in line with object names.
3. **Levels representation**: Make sure to only use characters defined in the `legend`.

After implementing these changes, the code should compile, and the settings should be applied correctly.
