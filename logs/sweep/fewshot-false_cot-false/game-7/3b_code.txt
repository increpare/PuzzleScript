The console errors indicate that there are issues with the `colors` section of your PuzzleScript code. Specifically, the parser is trying to match object names like `Background`, `Wall`, `Player`, and `Box` with their respective colors immediately after, but it seems to be reading object names directly from your code as mixed case (while game parsing tends to expect lower case). Here's a fixed version that addresses these issues by ensuring consistency in naming conventions and fixing the syntax for color assignments.

This corrected version ensures consistent naming throughout the definition and uses lowercase for object and color keywords in the `colors` section to match how PuzzleScript expects the input. This should resolve the errors and compile correctly.
