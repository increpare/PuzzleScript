The errors in the console output suggest issues with unexpected tokens in the prelude section and the colors section. Specifically, there are formatting problems in how the colors are associated with the objects. Let's fix these by ensuring the colors are linked properly, and the syntax is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code:

These corrections ensure that the `options` block syntax is right (without curly braces), and the way colors are defined matches the PuzzleScript syntax expectations, linking each object to its respective color correctly.
