Certainly! It seems there are some issues with identifying the objects and their corresponding colors. Specifically, it looks like the color definitions have been switched with the legend entries. Here's a repaired version of the code with these issues corrected:

In this version, I've corrected the color assignments under the `colors` section so that each game element has the appropriate color assigned to its name. This should resolve the compilation issues you were encountering.
