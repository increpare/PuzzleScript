This game consists of simple mechanics where the player (`P`) pushes boxes (`B`) onto goals (`G`). When a box is on a goal, it becomes (`O`), and when the player is on a goal, they become (`Q`). The player wins when all boxes are on goals (`BoxOnGoal`).

Feel free to expand on this template. Add more levels, objects, or rules to create a more complex game!
