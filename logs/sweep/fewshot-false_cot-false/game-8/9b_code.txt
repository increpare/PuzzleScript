### Explanation:
1. **Wall Sprite Correction**: The Wall sprite graphics mistakenly referred to a color index that didn't exist. I replaced the '1's with the symbol '#' as intended, adapting the graphics to the correct color indexing.
2. **Rule Consistency**: In the rule for `BoxOnGoal`, I added the `Goal` to the right side to make the pattern lengths consistent on both sides of the rule, solving the compilation error at lines 94 and 96.
