Certainly! The errors you're encountering are related to incorrect color definitions in the "Wall" and "PlayerOnGoal" objects. The "Wall" object tries to use a color index that's incorrect, and "PlayerOnGoal" has an undefined color name. We need to fix these issues to ensure the game compiles correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

- The `"WALL"` object did not have the color references properly set, they should be `#ffffff` for a single color.
- Changed `"LUIGREEN"` to `"LIGHTGREEN"` for `"PlayerOnGoal"` because `"LUIGREEN"` was not defined. 

You should now have a working game without compilation errors.
