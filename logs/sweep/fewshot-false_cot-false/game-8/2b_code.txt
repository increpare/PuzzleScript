The provided PuzzleScript game code has multiple issues. The errors stem from incorrect color definitions, improper rule syntax, and rule pattern mismatches. Here's a repaired version of the code that addresses these issues:

### Changes and Fixes Made:
1. **Wall Color Palette**: The `Wall` object had duplicate color entries in its sprite definition. I updated its sprite to use only correct palette entries.
2. **Rule Syntax and Pattern Matching**: Fixed the rules that didn't have matching left and right patterns. The rules now correctly transform objects with matching cell quantities on both sides.
3. **BoxOnGoal Object Sprite**: Improved the sprite to match the style of other objects while correctly representing its purpose.

Now the code should compile and execute without errors.
