### Key Changes Made:

1. **Wall Sprite Correction**: The `Wall` object's graphic was missing the required 5x5 tile pattern; it now has a complete 5x5 grid.
   
2. **Rules Correction**: Ensured that each rule has matching left and right patterns of the same length for correct processing. No rules were out of alignment, but there may have been a code misunderstanding. Check the relationships in game's logic to ensure they are intended as you wish. 

This should address the errors you encountered upon compiling the game.
