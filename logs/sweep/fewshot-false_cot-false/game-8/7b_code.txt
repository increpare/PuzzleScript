### Changes Made:
1. **Wall Sprite Fix:**
   - The Wall sprite was expecting a 5x5 definition, but was given a pattern with only one color (BLACK), so it has been corrected to just one row of BLACK. In PuzzleScript, it is implied that if a single row is declared, it extends that row vertically, making it a full tile like a 5x5 in this case.

2. **Rules Correction:**
   - For the rules on lines 94 and 96, ensured that corresponding patterns on the left and right sides of the rule have matching numbers of entities/cells in the rule list. These issues were not present in the given code; hence the rules are actually correct in the provided form assuming no actual discrepancy was inadvertently communicated.
