Here's the repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. The errors have been addressed:

1. The `Wall` sprite's color definition was incorrect. It should have a defined color palette and primarily uses character '1'. I adjusted it to 'BLACK' which is more typical.
2. There were issues with some rules where the right-hand side did not match the pattern length on the left. This has been corrected.

The main fixes involved correcting the Wall sprite's color issue and ensuring that rules with patterns on the left have corresponding right patterns of equal length, which is necessary for the PuzzleScript syntax.
