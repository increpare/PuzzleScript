The errors indicated in the console output refer to issues with the Wall sprite's color palette and mismatched pattern lengths in your rules. Here's a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Wall Pattern:** The Wall pattern in the `OBJECTS` section had `11111` for rows, but these represented access to non-existent color palettes in one color. I replaced those with the correct `.....` format. Since GREY should be your main color, there was no need for numbers—this is because Pattern uses `1` only for sprites with multi-colored use.

2. **Rule Pattern Match:** Ensure that each pattern on the left of the rules in the `RULES` section corresponds to a pattern on the right of equal length. This has been rectified, especially in the lines related to PlayerOnGoal and BoxOnGoal.

This updated code should fix the errors indicated and allow the game to compile and function correctly.
