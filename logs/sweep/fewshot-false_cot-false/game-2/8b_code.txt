The issues in the code seem to be related to the incorrect format for defining objects and their properties. Here's a revised version of the code addressing these errors:

```plaintext
=======
title Sokoban Clone
author YourName

========
objects
  Wall
    color #422
  Floor
    color #ccc
  Player
    color #00f
    layer 1
  Box
    color #ff0
    layer 2
  Goal
    color #f00
    layer 3

========
legend
    . = Floor
    # = Wall
    P = Player
    B = Box
    X = Goal

========
sounds
    movePlayer action
    moveBox action

=======
rules
[ Player | Box ] -> [ | Player Box ]
[ Player | ] (up) -> [ | Player ^ ]
[ Player | ] (down) -> [ | Player v ]
[ Player | ] (left) -> [ | Player < ]
[ Player | ] (right) -> [ | Player > ]

=======
winconditions
All Box on Goal

=======
levels

#####   
#...# 
#.#.# 
#.P.# 
#.B.# 
##### 

```

Key changes:
- Removed unnecessary `=` in the "sounds" section.
- Other sections were already correctly formatted. 

Now, the code should compile without errors.
