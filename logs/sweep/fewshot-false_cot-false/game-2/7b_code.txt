The errors you're encountering are because the use of colons and spaces in the color assignment is not recognized by PuzzleScript. The correct format is to use the keyword `color` followed directly by the color value, without colon or space. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```plaintext
=======
title Sokoban Clone
author YourName

========
objects
  Wall
    color #422
  Floor
    color #ccc
  Player
    color #00f
    layer 1
  Box
    color #ff0
    layer 2
  Goal
    color #f00
    layer 3

========
legend
    . = Floor
    # = Wall
    P = Player
    B = Box
    X = Goal

========
sounds
    movePlayer = action
    moveBox = action

=======

[ Player | Box ] -> [ | Player Box ]
[ Player | ] (up) -> [ | Player ^ ]
[ Player | ] (down) -> [ | Player v ]
[ Player | ] (left) -> [ | Player < ]
