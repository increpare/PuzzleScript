The errors are due to incorrect formatting and usage in the `objects` section of the PuzzleScript code. Each object should have its name followed by properties like color and layer, without extra indentation. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```plaintext
=======
title Sokoban Clone
author YourName

========
objects
  Wall 
    color #422  
    
  Floor 
    color #ccc
    
  Player 
    color #00f 
    layer 1
    
  Box 
    color #ff0 
    layer 2
    
  Goal 
    color #f00 
    layer 3

========
legend
    . = Floor
    # = Wall
    P = Player
    B = Box
    X = Goal

========

    movePlayer action
    moveBox action

[ Player | Box ] -> [ | Player Box ]
[ Player | ] (up) -> [ | Player ^ ]
[ Player | ] (down) -> [ | Player v ]
[ Player | ] (left) -> [ | Player < ]
[ Player | ] (right) -> [ | Player > ]

#####

#.#.#

These adjustments ensure that the objects and their properties are formatted correctly according to the PuzzleScript syntax.
