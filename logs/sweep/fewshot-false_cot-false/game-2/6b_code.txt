Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. The original issue was a result of incorrect formatting for object definitions, especially with color and layer specifications. The specifications should be formatted as key-value pairs within the object definition, separated by colons.

In this corrected version, I have inserted colons between properties (like `color`, `layer`) and their respective values. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile and function as intended.
