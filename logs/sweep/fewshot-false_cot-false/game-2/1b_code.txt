Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. I've rearranged the sections and ensured all object definitions are in the correct place:

```plaintext
=======
title Sokoban Clone
author YourName

========
objects
  Wall 
    color #422
    solid true
  Floor
    color #ccc
  Player
    color #00f
    layer 1
  Box 
    color #ff0
    layer 2
  Goal
    color #f00
    layer 3

========
legend
    . = Floor
    # = Wall
    P = Player
    B = Box
    X = Goal

========
sounds
    movePlayer = action
    moveBox = action

========
collisions
    P -> movePlayer
    B -> moveBox

=======
rules
[ Player | Box ] -> [ | Player Box ]
[ Player | ] (up) -> [ | Player ^ ]
[ Player | ] (down) -> [ | Player v ]
[ Player | ] (left) -> [ | Player < ]
[ Player | ] (right) -> [ | Player > ]

=======
winconditions
All Box on Goal

=======
levels

This version should work correctly in PuzzleScript, as it follows the appropriate structure and includes all necessary sections in the correct order.
