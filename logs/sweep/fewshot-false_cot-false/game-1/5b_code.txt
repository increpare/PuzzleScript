The error suggests that the initial level configuration doesn't allow the player to push all the crates onto the targets, hence it is unsolvable. Let’s modify the level or the rules to ensure it can be solved. Here’s the fixed game code:

This revised level layout provides a path for the player to move crates onto the targets without any obstacles making it impossible. You can try this level configuration to ensure that it meets the win condition of having `All CrateOnTarget`.
