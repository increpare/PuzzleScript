The console output indicates a problem with the sound definition. In PuzzleScript, the sound definition under the `SOUNDS` section should correctly specify the parameters for the syntax. The correct syntax for defining a sound is:

```
SoundId DirectionOrWhen1 Frequency1:Duration1 Frequency2:Duration2
```

It seems like there was a misunderstanding in the format. I'll provide the corrected version of the code by ensuring that the sound properties are appropriately defined or by removing the problematic lines because PuzzleScript's sound feature is relatively simplistic and automatically handled. Here is the fixed version of the code:

This code snippet adjusts the `SOUNDS` section by specifying a simple sound command structure: object name, event type, and a single frequency-duration pair. Depending on PuzzleScript's version and capabilities, it can be further adjusted to match the exact syntax requirements. Note that if further issues arise, more troubleshooting may be necessary specific to the version of PuzzleScript being used.
