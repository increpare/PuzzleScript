The error you encountered is due to the use of spaces in the level map, which haven't been defined in the OBJECTS or LEGEND section of your PuzzleScript code. PuzzleScript requires all symbols used in the level map to be explicitly defined. The spaces, which represent empty background in your map, need to be defined in your LEGEND section.

Here's a fixed version of your code:

In the corrected version, I've added a space character to the LEGEND section that maps to the "Background" object, which stands for empty spaces in the level maps. Now, the game should compile and run correctly without errors.
