Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. I've addressed the errors regarding the use of comments and spaces.

### Changes Made:

1. Removed the extra `  = Background` from the LEGEND section which was causing confusion because spaces are not needed to be defined explicitly here.
2. Removed the space from the error-causing line in the LEVELS section and replaced the interior spaces with `.` for the legend Background.

This code should compile and work as intended for your Simple Sokoban game.
