Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issue was with the sound definition. The correct sound verbs, such as "MOVE", need to be used appropriately. I've modified the sound section to resolve the errors:

I've changed "PLAYERMOVE" to "MOVE" in the sound definition, as "MOVE" is the correct sound verb to use.
