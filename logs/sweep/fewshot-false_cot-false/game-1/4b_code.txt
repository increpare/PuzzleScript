The issue you're encountering is with the sound declaration. The format should match the requirements for PuzzleScript's sound volume and pitch. Let's correct that:

```plaintext

In this corrected version, I've adjusted the sound declaration to use a single value, which is the default way of specifying sound in PuzzleScript. Let me know if you need further assistance!
