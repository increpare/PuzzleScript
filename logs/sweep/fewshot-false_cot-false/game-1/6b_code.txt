To make the provided level solvable, we need to ensure that all crates can be pushed onto target spaces and that the player can reach and move them accordingly without any issues. Reviewing the initial level, it seems that the positioning of the crates, targets, and the player could lead to an awkward configuration or even a deadlock. Let's adjust the level layout to ensure that it is solvable:

In this adjusted level, I've opened up the space a bit more and repositioned the player and crate to allow a clear pathway to solve the puzzle: 

- The player starts directly below a crate that can be pushed onto a target.
- The targets are accessible, providing enough space and options to move the crates onto them effectively.
  
Now, the level should be solvable with a straightforward path for the player to push the crate onto the target. This should resolve the solvability error.
