The issues in the original code come from a few key areas: 
1. The `SOUNDS` section mistakenly defines a sound effect for a condition without using a valid verb, and also tries to specify a sound pattern without correctly placing it within `SOUNDS` syntax.
2. The level map uses a space character instead of a defined tile symbol for some areas.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

Changes:
- Removed undefined sound event and replaced it with a valid sound structure. Note that in PuzzleScript, sounds usually need an associated event (e.g. PLAYERMOVE) to be triggered.
- Spaces in the level map have been replaced by dots (.) which represent the `Background` tile.
