### Explanation:

- **Title, Author, Homepage**: Basic metadata about the game.
- **Objects**: Define the elements of the game, like the player, walls, crates, targets, etc. Each has a color.
- **Legend**: Maps characters to objects to make level creation easier.
- **Sounds**: Define a simple sound that plays when a crate reaches a target.
- **CollisionLayers**: Dictates which objects can overlap during the game, e.g., the player or a crate cannot move through walls.
- **Rules**: Define the logic of movement and interaction between objects.
- **WinConditions**: The player wins when all crates are on targets.
- **Levels**: Define the layout of the initial level using the symbols defined in the Legend.

You can extend this example with more levels, varied rules, additional objects, or complex interactions.
