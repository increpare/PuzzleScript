The errors are caused by incorrect sprite definitions and a stray empty line in the SOUNDS section. PuzzleScript sprites should be on a single line of text. Let's correct the sprite definitions and remove any unnecessary lines. Here's the repaired version of the code:

Notice that I have collapsed the sprite matrices for `Player`, `Crate`, `Target`, and `CrateDone` into single lines, and removed the unwanted lines from the SOUNDS section. This should resolve the errors and allow your game to compile correctly.
