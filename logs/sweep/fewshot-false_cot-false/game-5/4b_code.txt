To fix the errors, the syntax for defining colors in the OBJECTS section needs correction. Additionally, the issues with object definitions, sprite matrices, and overlapping keys should be addressed. Here is the repaired version of the code:

########
```

**Notes on changes:**
1. The color definitions have been adjusted by removing the `.` and `#` before the color names and using either an empty space or just specifying a color for simple fill or surroundings respectively.
2. Sprite matrices shouldn't exceed the defined pattern size—a consistent `.0P0` pattern is used.
3. The matrix should correctly represent the desired visual while sticking to supported structures in PuzzleScript.
4. Every object defined in the OBJECTS section must use a consistent grid layout for their appearance.
