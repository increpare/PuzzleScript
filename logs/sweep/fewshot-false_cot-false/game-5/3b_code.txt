Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. I've addressed the formatting issues and object definitions to ensure it compiles correctly.

The corrections made include:
- Fixed object definitions by removing redundant "#" and ensuring the color follows the object name.
- Removed unnecessary object definition lines that were causing errors.
- Corrected the naming consistency of `Cratedone` to `CrateDone` across the entire code.
