The errors in your PuzzleScript code are mainly due to incorrect sprite matrix formatting for the objects and a problem in the `WINCONDITIONS` section which should use an entity rather than "CrateDone on Target". Here is the corrected version of your code:

```

**Key modifications:**
1. **Sprite Matrices**: Each object represents 5 characters per line and each matrix has exactly 5 lines in total, e.g., "XXXXX" for Wall instead of using dots around.
2. **CrateDone Color**: Changed from brown to orange for distinction, as color can sometimes be arbitrarily set for visibility and correction purposes.
3. **Win Conditions**: Changed from "All CrateDone on Target" to "All CrateDone", as there's no need to qualify the position again if `CrateDone` marks success.

These changes should correct the errors you're encountering.
