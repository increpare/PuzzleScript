### Key Changes:
1. **Sprite Dimensions**: Each sprite is now 5x5, as required by PuzzleScript. I've adjusted the sprites to create a 5x5 matrix for each object.
   
2. **Corrected Sprites**: Updated sprite definitions to adhere to the 5x5 grid, and make sure characters like `P`, `C`, `T`, `D` are consistent throughout.

3. **Removed Commented Placeholder**: Removed the note about adding custom sounds because the code was warning about unrecognized elements. The sound section is currently empty since no custom sounds are defined. 

This should address the errors in the original code and help you compile the game correctly.
