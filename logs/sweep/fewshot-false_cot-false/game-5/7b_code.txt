Certainly! The issues with your code stem from incorrect sprite matrix formatting and some extraneous text or errors that need correction. Below is the corrected code:

```

I've corrected the sprite definitions by ensuring each sprite has three rows, and removed the non-existent sounds section error by keeping it as commented since there are no sound events or definitions present. Also ensured the LEVELS section had the correct syntax with no spurious characters. This code should now compile without errors.
