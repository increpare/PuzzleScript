The errors you're encountering are due to improperly defined sprites where a color letter or number is expected. PuzzleScript uses letters ('a','b','c',...) to define colors in objects, corresponding to a color palette implicitly or explicitly defined earlier in the code. Here is the corrected version of your code:

**Notes:**
1. You need to define your object sprites with actual color codes (like `a`, `b`, etc.), which should match with colors in your palette. If no palette is explicitly given, these are usually pre-defined basic colors.
2. The color codes for the characters used in Wall and other objects should be consistent across your definitions.
3. Ensure your game renders correctly, and think about explicitly defining a color palette next time if you have multiple colors, to specify the visual appearance more clearly.
