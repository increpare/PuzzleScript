The errors you are encountering are due to the excessive dots ('.') in the sprite matrix for the player and crate objects. These extra dots are not required. Each object should have a 5x5 sprite representation with only one symbol on each line, utilizing spaces for unused parts of the grid.

Here is the corrected version of your game code:

```

In the corrected code, each object is now defined with a single pixel representation in a 5x5 grid format without the extra unnecessary dots extending the sprite. Each line in the sprite matrix is kept simple with accurate positioning of the filled pixels.
