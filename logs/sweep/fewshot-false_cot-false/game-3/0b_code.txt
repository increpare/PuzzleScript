In this game, `#` represents walls, `P` is the player, `C` is a crate, and `T` is the target. The goal is to move all crates (`C`) onto the targets (`T`) to change them into `X`, representing "CrateOnTarget". The level included is simplified, but you can expand the game by adding more complex levels under the `LEVELS` section.
