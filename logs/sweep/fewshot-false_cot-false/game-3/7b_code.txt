Certainly! The error messages indicate issues with the use of spaces, incorrect usage of rules, and syntax errors. Here's a corrected version of your code:

### Key Corrections:
1. **Whitespace Errors**: Ensure there's no unrecognized symbol (like a space) causing errors in the map definition. Instead of spaces, use the defined `Background` symbol `.` in levels.
2. **Rules Syntax**: Corrected the rules to have a valid end condition and pattern matching. Each left-hand side now has a corresponding right-hand side with proper directional movements.
3. **Crate and Player on Target**: Fixed the conversion and rules for handling crates and player interactions with target tiles.

This should resolve the compilation issues, provided no additional unrecognized characters are hiding in the original input, and align the code with PuzzleScript's requirements.
