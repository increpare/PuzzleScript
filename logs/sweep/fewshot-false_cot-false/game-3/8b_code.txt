The error messages you're seeing are due to the rules trying to express movements without acting on an object, as well as mismatched patterns between the left and right sides of rules. Additionally, the console output indicates that the symbol " " (empty space) is used in the map but isn't defined in the LEGEND.

To fix these issues, we need to adjust the rules to ensure movements are specified correctly, define an empty space symbol in the LEGEND, and make sure both sides of the rule have matching patterns.

Here is the repaired code:

In this corrected version:

- An empty space " " is defined as a Background in the LEGEND.
- All movement rules now correctly move both the Player and the Crate, or PlayerOnTarget and Crate, ensuring each pattern is matched for length and performs a valid transformation.
