Certainly! The errors you've encountered are due to some formatting and definition issues in the code. Here's a fixed version:

1. The PuzzleScript engine requires a section for sounds, even if it's empty, it should be denoted by `SOUNDS` with no additional separators or comments.
2. The space character for `Background` wasn't explicitly added in the `LEGEND` section.

Here's the corrected version of your code:
