Certainly! Below is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. I've fixed the syntax errors and ensured that the game should compile correctly without issues.

### Key Changes:

1. **Color for PlayerOnTarget:** Changed the color "cyan" to "lightblue" as it seems to have been incorrectly typed in the error message.

2. **Rule Syntax:** Adjusted the syntax of the rules. Objects and directions need to be correctly placed inside rule patterns and reformatted to fit within brackets correctly. The correct format inside brackets is `Player | Crate -> Player | >`.
