To address the issues present in the original PuzzleScript code, I'll correct the following:

1. Ensure no extraneous characters on section dividers.
2. Fix any issues with the rules missing objects in each cell.
3. Remove the space in the map that wasn't defined in the LEGEND section.
4. Ensure all rules are symmetrical in terms of the number of elements on each side of the rule arrow.

Here's a revised version of the game code:

Changes made:

- Removed any sections with extra characters after the section title.
- Fixed rules so that each movement specification correctly acts upon the intended objects, ensuring balanced transformation (e.g., converting objects as needed).
- Removed references to undefined map symbols.
- Double-checked the win condition to ensure it aligns with the objects available in the game.
