The errors you encountered are due to the fact that objects are not correctly placed within square brackets in the movement rules. In PuzzleScript, objects should be placed inside square brackets along with their corresponding directions. Let's fix that:

With these corrections, the objects in the rules are now consistently enclosed in square brackets, aligning with PuzzleScript's syntax requirements. This should resolve your compilation errors.
