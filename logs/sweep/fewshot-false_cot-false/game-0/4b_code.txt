Certainly! Here's a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I addressed the sprite size issues, moved the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section below the "OBJECTS" section, corrected the "PLAYER" keyword error, and added a representation for walls in the level definitions.

In this corrected version, the walls are represented by `W` in both the `LEGEND` and the `LEVELS`, and the player is correctly defined by `P` to fit the `LEGEND` definition. The code now adheres to the constraints required by the PuzzleScript engine.
