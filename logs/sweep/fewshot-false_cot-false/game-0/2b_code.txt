### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Sprite dimensions**: Ensure all sprites are 5x5 by adding appropriate lines of dots (e.g., `.....`) where necessary.
   
2. **Section order**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section was placed before the `RULES` section, aligning with the required order.

3. **Object names in rules**: Made sure the attributes and object names in the rules used the correct case-sensitive versions that match the ones declared in the `LEGEND`.

4. **Corrected Rules**:
   - Fixed the rules to ensure proper collision behavior.
   - Added necessary movement indicators (`>`) to specify directional movement.

These corrections should eliminate the errors and make the game compile and function correctly.
