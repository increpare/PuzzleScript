The error messages indicate that the characters "L", "A", "Y", "E", and "R" were incorrectly included in the `PLAYER` section, which led to the errors because those letters were not defined as objects or part of the legend. The `PLAYER` section should only include the player's character symbol, in this case, `P`.

Here is the corrected code:

This version should compile without errors, and the player object is correctly defined as `P`.
