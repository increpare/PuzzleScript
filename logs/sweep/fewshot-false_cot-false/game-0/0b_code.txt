### Explanation:

- **Title and Author**: These sections contain metadata for the game.

- **Objects**: Four objects are defined—Player, Crate, Wall, Target, and CrateOnTarget. Each has a visual representation using basic bitmap patterns.

- **Legend**: This section maps characters in the level designs to game objects.

- **Sounds**: Sound effects are defined for when crates slide and when the player wins the game.

- **Rules**: Defines how objects interact. For example, a player can push crates onto targets, transforming crates into ‘CrateOnTarget.’

- **Collision Layers**: Specifies how objects interact physically in the game space. The player must navigate around walls and push crates, which can exist in the same layer as the player.

- **Player**: Indicates which object the player controls.

- **Levels**: Defines a set of levels using ASCII characters. The player must push crates onto targets to win each level.

- **Win Conditions**: Specifies the conditions to win the game, which in this case is getting all crates onto targets.
