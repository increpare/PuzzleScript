Let's address the errors and fix the PuzzleScript code. 

1. `Background` needs to be represented by a period `.` in the level maps.
2. The issue with "Maps must be rectangular" is due to levels having lines of different lengths.
3. The PLAYER section does not require anything after it.
4. Ensure space ` ` is represented by the correct object in the level section.

Here's the corrected version:

Fixes were applied in:
- Objects section, ensuring the Background is denoted correctly.
- Legend section to use the period `.` for Background.
- Levels were adjusted to use the period `.` for spacing and to ensure all rows in each level have the same length.
- Removed unnecessary texts in PLAYER section. The PLAYER section does not need additional text or objects.
