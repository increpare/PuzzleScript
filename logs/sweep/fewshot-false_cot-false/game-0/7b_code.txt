Certainly! Let's correct the issues identified in the console output. The main problems seem to be:

1. The `PLAYER` and `P` sections are misplaced and interpreted as incorrect inputs in the `WINCONDITIONS`.
2. The levels must have the same number of columns in each row; they must be rectangular.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

- The `PLAYER` section has been moved to the correct location after `WINCONDITIONS`.
- The levels have been corrected to ensure all rows are the same length, making them rectangular.
