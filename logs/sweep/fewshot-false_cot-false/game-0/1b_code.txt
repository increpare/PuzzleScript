Here's a corrected version of the PuzzleScript code, addressing the issues mentioned in the console output:

### Changes and Fixes Explained:
1. **Sprite Size and Formatting:** 
   - The sprite representations have been corrected to fit a 5x5 grid with appropriate placement of dots (`.`) for unused spaces.
   
2. **Color Issue for Player Object:**
   - Adjusted the color definition line to directly use `Yellow` followed by a 5x5 dot and number pattern.
   
3. **Sound Section Removed:**
   - Since the provided PuzzleScript does not inherently support sound or its tokens (`CrateSlide`, `Win`, `Push`, `Triumphant`), that section is removed for compatibility.

4. **Legend Redefinition:**
   - Changed the assignment symbol for `Background` from `.` to `=` to avoid collisions with the object name.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors and help in running the game successfully.
