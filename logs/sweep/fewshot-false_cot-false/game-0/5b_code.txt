Here is a corrected version of the PuzzleScript code addressing all the reported errors. This includes ensuring all sprites are 5x5 in size, simplifying win conditions, correcting level maps to ensure they are rectangular, and adding missing legend entries.

Corrections made:
- Ensured all sprite graphics have dimensions of 5x5.
- Simplified win condition to "All CrateOnTarget".
- Corrected all level maps to ensure they are rectangular and consistent in length. 
- Removed usage of " " (spaces) and "." as the syntax didn't need them for empty spaces in the map.
