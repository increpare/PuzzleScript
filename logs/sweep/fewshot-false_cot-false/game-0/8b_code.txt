The error messages indicate that there are objects or symbols used in the LEVELS section that are not defined in the LEGEND section. Specifically, the errors are related to the absence of symbols L, A, Y, E, and R, but the specific issue seems to be related to a misinterpretation or misalignment within the LEVELS.

The code listed in the LEVELS section seems correctly corresponding to the LEGEND entries. Hence, there might be a misplaced string or a formatting issue leading to these errors. Upon closer inspection, we will make sure there is consistent formatting and fix the LEVELS section if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

There were no syntax or logic errors in the defined objects, legend, or rules. The problem might have stemmed from an invisible character or misalignment when copying the code. With the corrections, this code should compile properly.
