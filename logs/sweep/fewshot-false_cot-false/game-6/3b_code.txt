The errors in your code stem from incorrect entries in the 'Sprite definitions' section. The `player`, `wall`, `floor`, and `star` definitions need to have each pixel entry consisting of a single character ranging from 0 to 5, where "0" represents transparency, "1" to "5" represent different colors. By fixing these definitions, the console errors will be resolved. Here's the corrected version of your game code:

I adjusted the `player` sprite definition by ensuring all lines have only five characters and use only 0-5 to represent colors. This should resolve the errors related to "Unrecognised stuff in the prelude" and allow the game to compile correctly.
