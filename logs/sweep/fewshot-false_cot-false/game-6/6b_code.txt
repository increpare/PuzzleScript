It looks like the game description has incorrect formatting for the sprite definitions section. Let's fix the sprite definitions so the compiler can recognize them properly. Here's the corrected code:

In this version of the code, I've made sure the sprite definitions are consistent with the syntax conventions of the PuzzleScript language by using the `OBJECTS` keyword, specifying color for each object, and ensuring the size of each sprite matches the engine's requirements (5x5 with centered designs using dots for transparency where appropriate).
