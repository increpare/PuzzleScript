### Changes Made:
1. **Added the `SOUNDS` Section:** The error message indicated that there was a missing `SOUNDS` section that must precede the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. I added this section and left it empty, as seems intended. 

2. **Capitalization in `RULES`:** The object names in the `RULES` section need to match those defined in the `OBJECTS` and `LEGEND`. The first letters were capitalized to match those names.

3. **Corrected `WINCONDITIONS`:** The win condition was changed to `No Star` instead of `All star on`, to properly correspond with the game's task of collecting all stars and winning the game once they are all collected. 

4. **Checked Object Names:** Ensured consistency in naming objects in rules and win conditions (case sensitivity).
