Certainly! The main issues with the provided PuzzleScript code are the incorrect use of the 'SOUNDS' section and the lack of definition for the wall character ('#') in the LEGEND section. PuzzleScript doesn't have a native 'SOUNDS' section, nor does it support playing audio in the way specified. Also, the wall object's corresponding symbol needs to be added to the LEGEND section.

Here's the corrected version of the puzzle:

In this version, the '#' character for representing walls is added to the LEGEND section. The 'SOUNDS' section is removed since it is currently not supported by PuzzleScript. It should compile correctly now without errors.
