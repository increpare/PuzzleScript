Certainly! It seems the prelude, which includes metadata like the title, author, and homepage, is incorrectly interpreted in your PuzzleScript code. In the PuzzleScript language, everything before "==========" is considered a part of the prelude/comments and is usually ignored. However, to prevent "Unrecognised stuff" errors, let's ensure that your prelude is entirely ignored or written correctly. Here's a repaired version of your code:

Key fixes:
1. I've commented out the prelude lines (title, author, homepage) to prevent them from causing errors.
2. Fixed potential issues with sprite definitions formatting to ensure they only use '0' and '1'.
3. Changed 'Color' to 'Colors' as that is the correct section header.

With these corrections, your game should compile without errors in PuzzleScript.
