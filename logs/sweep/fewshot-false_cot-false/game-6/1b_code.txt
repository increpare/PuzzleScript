To fix the errors reported in the console output, we need to ensure there are no blank lines between metadata fields like "Title", "Author", and "Homepage". Let's modify the code accordingly:

In this revised code, I removed the empty lines following each metadata field, which should resolve the syntax errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
