The errors in the console output suggest that there's an issue with how the sprite matrices for the objects are defined. It seems that the color codes in the matrices are not recognized. In PuzzleScript, the matrix should consist of a fixed grid of color codes, and periods (`.`) should be replaced with a valid color identifier defined in the "COLORS" section. I'll correct the spritematrix by assigning appropriate colors, assuming standard color identifiers can be used directly in the matrix.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

This version should correctly interpret the objects without errors. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
