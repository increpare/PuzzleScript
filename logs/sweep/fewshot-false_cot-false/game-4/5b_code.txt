The error messages indicate that there are issues with the spritematrix definitions for the `Player` and `Star` objects. The spritematrix should be composed of single-character color values that match the colors defined in the `COLORS` section, and they should form a visually consistent representation. However, in this case, colors were directly inputted in words instead of using a single character, leading to errors.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

In the corrected version, I've replaced the capitalized letters in the `Player` and `Star` objects' spritematrix definitions with lowercase letters. This resolves the "unknown junk" error by ensuring the matrix uses single-character representations consistent with the rest of the code logic.
