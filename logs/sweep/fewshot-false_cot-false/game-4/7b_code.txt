The errors you're encountering are likely due to the definition of the sprite matrix for the Player and Star objects. In PuzzleScript, the sprite matrix should be a square grid of pixels represented as a sequence of characters. Ensure that there are no extraneous or unexpected characters in each row of the matrix. Here is the corrected version of the game:

In this corrected version, I've replaced the '0' with '.' in the player's and star's sprite matrix to clearly define the unused pixels in the sprite, which is the conventional representation in PuzzleScript for transparency or an unused space in a sprite. This should resolve the compilation errors you were facing.
