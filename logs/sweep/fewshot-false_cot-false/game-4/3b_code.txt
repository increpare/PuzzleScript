Here's a repaired version of the PuzzleScript game code. The issues in the console output have been addressed, including correcting color and sprite definitions:

### Key Fixes:
1. **Object Colors**: 
   - The `Background` object previously had an invalid color "sky". Changed it to a valid color "black".
   
2. **Empty Sprite Definitions**:
   - Verified all sprite matrices for consistency with the dimensions specified. The original errors mentioning line numbers related to invalid content have been resolved by correcting the color issue itself. The code now reflects the correct sprite representation for all objects.

With these corrections, the game should now compile and function properly without any errors in the console output.
