Certainly! The errors in the console output are due to incorrect sprite definitions for the Player and Star objects. Each matrix must use the colors defined for the object, and "p." and "s." are not valid color codes. I will fix these by using only the characters defined by their colors, 'p' for Player and 's' for Star. Here is the corrected code:

This code contains the corrected sprite definitions for both Player and Star objects, with incorrect characters replaced by their corresponding valid ones. You should no longer encounter the previous compilation errors.
