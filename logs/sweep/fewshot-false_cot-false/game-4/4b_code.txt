The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect formatting of the spritematrices for the Player and Star objects. The correct format for a 3x3 sprite should be 3 lines each containing 3 characters. Let's correct these errors in the spritematrices for Player and Star:

Make sure to replace each line of the spritematrix incorrectly formatted with a correct 3x3 arrangement. However, given that the existing representations seem correct for a classic 3x3 sprite (even if abstracted), the original symbols should work if formatted properly. Given the initial code doesn't have apparent issues in its declared 3x3 format, rechecking the setup for syntax, whitespace, or unexpected characters in the actual development environment may be the next step if issues persist.
