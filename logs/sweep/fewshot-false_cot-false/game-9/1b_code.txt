Certainly! The errors you encountered are mostly due to formatting issues and incorrect color inputs. Let's correct them:

1. The colors in PuzzleScript should be one of the predefined color names (like `speech`, `orange`, `green`, etc.), rather than containing spaces.
2. The rule line with "Player moving onto Target" just needs to be commented correctly.
3. The replacement of a specific line position with rule components that are incorrectly specified (such as "moving" and "onto") must be corrected.

Here is a fixed version of your script:

Changes made:
- Used `lightblue`, `yellow`, and `lightred` without spaces to avoid color parsing errors.
- Corrected the rule `[PlayerOnTarget] -> [Player]` to have consistent style.
- Fixed the erroneous line spacing issues by ensuring proper comment formatting that started the issues previously.
  
Try to run this corrected version, and it should compile without errors.
