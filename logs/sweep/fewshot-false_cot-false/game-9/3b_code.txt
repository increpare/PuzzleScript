The errors you're encountering are due to comments in the `RULES` section not being properly formatted or recognized by the PuzzleScript parser. Comments can sometimes cause issues if they are not prefixed correctly with a `#` alone on a line. I'll correct the errors by ensuring comments are properly recognized or removed if necessary and making sure the game can be compiled without errors. Here's the revised code:

Each rule has been formatted to ensure that comments won't interfere with processing. This cleaned version is expected to compile and function correctly.
