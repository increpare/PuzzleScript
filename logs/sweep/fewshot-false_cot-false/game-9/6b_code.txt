The errors in your code are caused by mismatched patterns in your rules. Specifically, every pattern on the left side of a rule must have the same number of objects as on the right side. The rules on lines 63 and 66 must be adjusted. Here is a fixed version of your game code:

```plaintext

Now, each rule's left side will have a corresponding pattern of equal length on the right side, satisfying PuzzleScript's requirements.
