To resolve the issue of non-solvable levels in your "Box Pusher" PuzzleScript game, we need to ensure each level is designed in such a way that all boxes can reach their respective targets. Below is the fixed version of the game code, featuring revised levels that are solvable:

**Explanation:**

- **Level 0:** A target (`X`) is added and adjusted so it's reachable by the box (`B`) considering the placement of walls.
- **Level 1:** The configuration is adapted to enable the player to move the box to the target, mindful of wall constraints to allow a clear pathway.

Make sure each level provides at least one unobstructed path to each box's respective target while considering player and object movement capabilities within the rule set.
