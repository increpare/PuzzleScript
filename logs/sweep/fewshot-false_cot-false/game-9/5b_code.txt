To address the issues outlined in the console output, we need to make the following corrections:

1. Ensure all levels are rectangular.
2. Replace the missing symbol "*" with the correct legend character ("X" for Target).
3. Ensure that each rule pattern has a corresponding pattern of equal length on both the left and right.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

Changes made:
- The levels have been adjusted to be completely rectangular by ensuring all rows have the same number of characters.
- Replaced the "*" symbol with "X" in the affected levels to use the defined Target object.
- Corrected the rule `[> Player | BoxOnTarget] -> [> Player |> Box]` to `[> Player | BoxOnTarget] -> [> Player | > Box]` to match cell patterns on both sides.
