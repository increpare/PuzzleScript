Certainly! Here's the updated version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've made sure the level is solvable by ensuring there is a clear path for the player to reach and interact with the gems using the mirrors.

In this version of the level:

1. I've moved the gems to positions where it's possible to reach them.
2. Mirrors have been arranged in such a way that they can be interacted with to create a proper path to collect the gems.
3. The layout ensures a solvable path for collecting all the gems while leveraging the mirror's interaction rules. 

If there are additional complexities you'd like to incorporate, feel free to specify!
