This corrected version of the game should compile without errors:

1. Corrected the color name for the "Mirror" object to use "Gray" instead of "Silver".
2. Corrected the color name for the "Gem" object to use "LightBlue" instead of "Cyan".
3. Changed the incorrect sound call syntax to use a valid sound verb "GemCollect" instead of incorrectly using "sound Gem collect".
4. Added an actual behavior for the Mirror to interact properly with the Player in the rules.
5. Corrected the rule formation to align with the PuzzleScript syntax for movement and interactions.
