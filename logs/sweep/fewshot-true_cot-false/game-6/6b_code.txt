In this version, I made slight adjustments to levels to ensure that each BouncyBlock can be moved onto its respective Target in various configurations. The original configuration for levels 1, 3, and 5 were not possible due to the layout, preventing the player from adequately maneuvering the blocks. Level 7 and level 9 were incorrectly mentioned; assuming the highest level is 5 based on your description and making necessary fixes here.
