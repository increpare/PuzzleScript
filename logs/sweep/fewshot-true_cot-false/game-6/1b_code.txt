Certainly! Based on the errors you reported, here's a repaired version of the PuzzleScript game code with explanations for each fix:

1. **Player Sprite Color Error**: The `Player` sprite uses more color indexes than the palette defines. We adjust the sprite artwork to use only the two defined colors (black and lightblue).

2. **Sound Verb Error**: The `BOUNCE` sound is being defined without a proper verb like `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, etc. We should ensure that `BOUNCE` is appropriately used in rules or replace it with a standard verb if needed.

3. **Rule Pattern Mismatch Error**: Each pattern on the left in a rule must correspond to a pattern of the same length on the right.

Here's the repaired code:

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified the `Player` sprite to use only the two defined colors (black and lightblue).
- Updated the sound declaration to use the `MOVE` verb for `BouncyBlock`.
- Corrected the rule "[BouncyBlock | Wall] -> [BouncyBlock]" to ensure the pattern matches are of equal length by expressing it as "[BouncyBlock | Wall] -> [BouncyBlock | Wall]".

This version addresses the errors and should compile correctly.
