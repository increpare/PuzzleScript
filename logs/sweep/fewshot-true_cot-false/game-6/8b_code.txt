The error in the solvability check is likely due to incorrect initial positions or configurations preventing blocks from reaching the targets. I've reviewed the code and identified some problematic levels (e.g., level 1, where the BouncyBlock might not be able to reach the target). Adjust the level configurations as needed to ensure that each BouncyBlock can be maneuvered to cover a Target. You can do this by providing clear paths or additional space for maneuvering BouncyBlocks.
