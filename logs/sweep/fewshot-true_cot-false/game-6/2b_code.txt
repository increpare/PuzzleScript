Changes made:
- Repositioned the Player (`P`) and BouncyBlock (`B`) in level 1: `#B.P#` to make it solvable.
- Repositioned the Player (`P`) and BouncyBlock (`B`) in level 3: `#..BP` to ensure solvability.

With these adjustments, the levels should be solvable, as there should now be paths for the player to push the BouncyBlock onto the Target (`O`).
