Here's a repaired version of the code for your Mirror Maze game. The errors were due to missing colors for the "Reflect" object. I've added the necessary color specifications:

I've specified three colors for the "Reflect" object in line 42 using `cyan LightBlue Blue`, which ensures that it matches the structure for other objects that use a color palette. This should resolve the compilation errors.
