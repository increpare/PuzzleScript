I've fixed the issues highlighted in your error log:
- The color definition for `Reflect` now has two colors (`cyan gray`) as required.
- The sound effects called `player_move` and `reflect_move` have been replaced with a single `sfx0` label.
- The rules have been updated to use `sfx0` for sound effects, ensuring it is defined and referred to correctly.
