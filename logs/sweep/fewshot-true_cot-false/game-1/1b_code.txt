Here are the changes made to the original code to fix the errors:

1. Corrected the `OBJECTS` section by ensuring all sprites are 5x5 pixels wide and high.
2. Fixed the color definition for `Reflect` to include color specification.
3. Updated the `SOUNDS` section to use the `MOVE` keyword correctly.
4. Ensured the rules trigger the correct sound effects using proper syntax.

I made sure your game code adheres to the syntax and constraints required by PuzzleScript.
