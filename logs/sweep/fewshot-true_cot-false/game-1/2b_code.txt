**Changes made:**
1. For the `Reflect` object, an additional color was added to fix the console error.
2. The sound names `MOVE` were replaced with `PlayerMove` and `ReflectMove` to match the usage in the rules.
3. Updated the rules to use the correct sound names by removing `MOVE` and appending them correctly as `ReflectMove` and `PlayerMove`.
