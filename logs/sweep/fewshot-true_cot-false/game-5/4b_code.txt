### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the `Goal` object color definition to include the required three colors: `gold yellow black`.
2. Corrected the `SOUNDS` section by specifying the type of sound (e.g., `MOVE`, `WIN`) for `KeyTaken` and `GoalMet`.
3. Modified the sound syntax in the rules to reference the sound identifiers correctly with the `sfx` keyword.
