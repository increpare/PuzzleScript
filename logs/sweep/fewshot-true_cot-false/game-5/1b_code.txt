The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect color indexing in the sprite definitions. PuzzleScript sprites and their colors should be declared using the correct syntax, specifying colors in a shorthand if multiple colors are being used. Let's fix the code by assigning colors correctly and managing color palettes properly:

I've corrected the color definitions for each object. Colors are now specified using color names, which should resolve the palette-related issues.
