#### Explanation:
- **Win Condition**: The win condition was updated to ensure that all players need to be on the goal to win.
- **Level Fixes**: Previously, levels 1 and 3 were not solvable due to the lack of adequate interaction to guide players to their goals. Level setups should be validated to ensure there are pathways to the goals or necessary interactions (keys and gates) within player-reachable distances. The third level was added/fixed analogously to level 1 to ensure solvability consistency and the message now concludes the quest appropriately.
