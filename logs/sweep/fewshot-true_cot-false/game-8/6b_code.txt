I made sure to list "Wall" in a separate line from "Player" and "Goal" in the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to prevent any unexpected behavior. Please make sure that your sounds are appropriately defined and used within the game. If you encounter any issues related to sounds not working, make sure that they are used within the game logic or the PuzzleScript game engine supports their use.
