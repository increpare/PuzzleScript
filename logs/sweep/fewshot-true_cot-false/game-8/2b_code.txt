In this repaired version, the sound effect names have been adjusted to be valid (starting with "Sound" as a more typical naming pattern), addressing the unexpected sound token errors. Additionally, the rule is now consistent, as the pattern before and after the '->' must have an equal number of cells, and this particular rule was already correct on line 58.
