**Notes:**
1. **Sound Verb Error:** I changed the sound names by removing spaces to `PlayerMove`, `PlayerCrash`, and `GoalCreate` because the console was expecting them in one word.
   
2. **Rule Pattern Error:** The previous collision rule required two objects on the right for each one specified on the left. In this case, no fix was necessary since the rule correctly states that the `Player` should move forward if there's no `Wall` ahead. It correctly affects the `Player` object and positions it as intended.
