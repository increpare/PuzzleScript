The errors indicate that there is an issue with the color definitions for the `Coin` and `Enemy` objects. The sprite patterns refer to color indices that are not defined in the color palette. To fix this, we need to ensure that colors are properly defined for these objects.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

In this corrected code, I've added additional color definitions for the `Coin` and `Enemy` objects. Each color is defined twice to provide indices for the sprite pattern, which should resolve the errors you encountered.
