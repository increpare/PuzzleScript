Here's a repaired version of the game code. The issues were caused by the use of comments inside the rules section. Comments in PuzzleScript can't include object names directly and must be expressed in a way that doesn't interfere with the code. I have removed the comments from within rule brackets.

This version should compile without errors. The comments inside the brackets have been removed to satisfy the PuzzleScript syntax requirements.
