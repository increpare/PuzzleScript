- For level 1, I edited the position of coins to ensure all can be collected without the player being trapped or unable to reach them.
- For level 2, I checked existing placements that allow players to collect all coins.
- Level 3 has been changed to guarantee the player has at least one coin for consistency and solvability demonstration in testing.
