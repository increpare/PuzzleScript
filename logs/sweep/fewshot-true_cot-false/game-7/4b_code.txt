Changes made:
1. Changed sound declarations from `collect`, `hit`, `win` to `sfx0`, `sfx1`, `sfx2` respectively to match PuzzleScript's sound declaration format.
2. Fixed the `[ > Player | Enemy ] -> [ Player | Enemy ] sfx1` rule so that rules only reference objects inside square brackets and make sure the enemy checks rule match the format `[ <direction> Enemy | Background ] -> [ Background | Enemy ]`.
3. Ensured that all levels and win conditions were consistent and corrected the errors regarding undefined rule mentions.
