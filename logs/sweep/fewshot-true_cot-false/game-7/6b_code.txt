To ensure solvability for both levels, we need to adjust the movement logic of the enemy and potentially the layout of the levels themselves. The enemy should pose a realistic threat and provide a challenge without making the level impossible. Here is a revised version of the game code with updated rules and levels:

Changes made:

1. **Enemy Movement:**
   - The enemy now moves left and right instead of up and down. This change makes it more challenging for the player to collect coins without getting caught and makes the enemy's path predictable.

2. **Level Layouts:**
   - Adjusted Level 2 to ensure it remains challenging yet solvable. This involved rearranging walls and coins to ensure all coins are reachable.
   - Confirmed that reachable paths exist in Level 1, ensuring the player can collect all coins without being blocked by the enemy or walls.

These changes give the player a chance to collect all coins while navigating around enemies and walls, ensuring solvability.
