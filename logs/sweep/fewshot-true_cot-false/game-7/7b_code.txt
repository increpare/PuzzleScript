Here's the corrected code for the game "Collect the Coins" with Level 1 made solvable. I've also included Level 3 as a celebratory level with no gameplay, as the message suggests that you've already completed the game.

In Level 1, the Player (P) now has a clear path to collect all Coins (C) without getting stuck or immediately encountering an Enemy (E). Level 3 serves as the end message without any gameplay challenge.
