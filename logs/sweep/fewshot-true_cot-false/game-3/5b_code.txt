I've corrected the error messages:
- Added a second color to the `Background`, `Bridge`, and `Ocean` objects for consistency with the object format requirements. The second color provided is set to match the first one (e.g., `SkyBlue SkyBlue`, `Grey Grey`, and `DarkBlue DarkBlue`).
- Original errors regarding coloring should now be resolved.
