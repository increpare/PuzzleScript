### Fixes made:
1. **Line 10**: Removed an extra space after "SkyBlue" for the `Background` object color definition.
2. **Lines 44-46**: Added a second color to the `Goal` sprite to fix the issue with trying to access an undefined color.
3. **Line 64**: Removed the comment that followed the equals sign marker for this section because that's not allowed.
4. **Line 73**: Removed an invalid character after the `Bridge BUILD` command which was likely causing issues due to syntax errors.
5. **Sound Definition**: Ensured that the `BUILD` keyword is valid and matches any needed syntax adjustments.

With these changes, the game should compile properly.
