Changes made:
1. Corrected the OBJECT scheme for colors by ensuring the color is listed per object without quotes around the color name.
2. Replaced the unintended usage of `LevelComplete` with a commented instruction `: LevelComplete` on a valid rule to invoke the `LevelComplete` sound correctly.
3. Added a `DESTROY` sound event for the `Ocean`.
4. Ensured each pattern on both sides of a rule has equal lengths, adhering to PuzzleScript's rule syntax requirements. 
5. Included comments to correctly indicate when a level is completed using sound.
