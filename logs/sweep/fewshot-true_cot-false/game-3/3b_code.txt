Here's what was fixed:
1. Added the second parameter to the `Background` object to correctly specify its color.
2. Removed the colon `:` and `LevelComplete` from the first rule. PuzzleScript doesn't have a `LevelComplete` keyword, so the objective is just to ensure the player steps on the goal to fulfill the win condition.
3. Removed the `Bridge BUILD` sound since `BUILD` is not a recognized action or sound. Kept the `Player MOVE` and corrected the `Ocean DESTROY`.
4. Fixed the symmetry and balance in the rules to ensure each cell in the pattern on the left side corresponds to the right side.
