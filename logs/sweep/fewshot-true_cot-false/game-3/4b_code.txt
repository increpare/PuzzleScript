Explanation of Fixes:
1. The color definition for the `Background` object was incorrect. `SkyBlue` should not be repeated. It should be defined as a single color.
2. There was an erroneous equals sign in the `SOUNDS` section, which should not be there, according to the error message.
3. In the rule `[ > Player | Background | Ocean ] -> [ > Player | Bridge ]`, each left side pattern component should have a corresponding component on the right side. So, I matched the `Background` with `Background` in the rule `[ > Player | Ocean Background ] -> [ > Player | Bridge Background ]`.
