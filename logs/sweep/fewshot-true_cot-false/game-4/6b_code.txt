Certainly! The issue with the level is that the player (P) cannot reach the gem and collect it, since there are no gems (G) in the level. Here is the revised code with the gem added in the level to make it solvable:

In this corrected version, I added a gem (G) in the level, so the player can collect it, allowing the game to be solvable.
