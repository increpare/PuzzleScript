Changes made:
- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section.
- Fixed capitalization errors to ensure consistency with the defined object names.
- Adjusted the `RULES` section to use the correct object names with appropriate capitalization and added the movement character `>` in front of `Player` to denote direction.
- Modified the `WINCONDITIONS` to use `no Gem`, which means all Gems must be collected for the player to win.
