Certainly, let's address the issue in the provided game code. The error indicates that the level isn't solvable according to the existing rules and win conditions. It's important that a level includes a path for the player to collect all the gems and reach the finish.

Here's a revised version of your game code ensuring the level is solvable:

**Changes Made:**
1. Adjusted the position of the walls and the finish to ensure the player can collect the gem and then reach the finish. The previous layout had the finish completely blocked.
2. Ensured logical positioning of elements for the player to start, collect the gem, and reach the finish.

Ensure that the logic in your rules allow the player to move through the level and clear all gems before reaching the finish. After these amendments, the level should now be solvable.
