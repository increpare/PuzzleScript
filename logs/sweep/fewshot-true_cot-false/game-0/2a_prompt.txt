RULES     
======     

[ > player ] [ stationary shadow ] -> [ > player ] [ < shadow ]

( 1. Propagate movements forward )
[ > Mover | stationary Movable ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable  ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box    ] [ > Box    ]
+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate  ] [ > Crate  ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest  ] [ > Chest  ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 2. Propagate obstructions backwards )
[ > Mover  | stationary Obstacle ] -> [ stationary Mover | Obstacle ]

	(the next lines deal with directional conflicts)
+ [ ^ Crate | < Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ ^ Crate | > Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ ^ Crate | v Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 

+ [ v Crate | < Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ v Crate | > Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ v Crate | ^ Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 

+ [ < Crate | > Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ < Crate | ^ Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ < Crate | v Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 

+ [ > Crate | < Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ > Crate | ^ Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 
+ [ > Crate | v Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate | stationary Crate ] 

(also one space removed)
+ [ > Mover | |  < Mover ] -> [ stationary Mover | |  < Mover ] 

+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate ] [ Crate ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ stationary Box   ] [ Box   ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ stationary Chest ] [ Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ stationary Glue | Glue ]

( 3. remove all movement, keep a flag )
[ > Movable ] -> [ Movable wanna_move ]

( 4. propagate movement only on wanna_move things )
(    ie redo step 1 but with WANNA_MOVE added to the first line below )
[ > Mover  | stationary Movable WANNA_MOVE ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable ]
+ [ > Box   ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box   ] [ > Box   ]
+ [ > Crate ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate ] [ > Crate ]
+ [ > Chest ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest ] [ > Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 5. cleanup, remove flag )
[ wanna_move ] -> [ ]
