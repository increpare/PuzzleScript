Key changes made:
1. Added a `Crate` alias under the `LEGEND` section representing `YellowBox`, `BlueBox`, and `RedBox`.
2. Renamed sound names in the `SOUNDS` section to `MoveSound`, `SwapSound`, and `PutDownSound` to prevent collisions with reserved keywords.
3. Modified the usage of sound effects in `RULES` to use the correct sound identifiers.
