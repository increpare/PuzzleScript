This repaired version of the game code includes an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to adhere to the required order. Additionally, I ensured that all object names in the rules match the definitions provided in the `OBJECTS` section, specifically addressing the incorrect casing of the object names.
