Explanation of Fixes:
- The capitalization of sound names in the `SOUNDS` section was not matching those used in the `RULES` section. I ensured that sound names are consistently capitalized: `MoveSound`, `SwapSound`, and `PutDownSound`. 

This should resolve the issues you encountered with the game code compilation.
