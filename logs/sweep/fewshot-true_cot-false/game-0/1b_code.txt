The errors in the console output indicate that there is an issue with the color definitions in the `YellowBox`, `BlueBox`, and `RedBox` objects. Each of these objects should have a color pattern defined with the specified colors. However, the current code attempts to access an undefined color index in those patterns. Let's correct this by properly defining the color patterns for these objects.

Here is a repaired version of the code:

In the corrected version, each `Box` object (`YellowBox`, `BlueBox`, and `RedBox`) has two colors defined, with the second color being black for contrast with the background. This resolves the error of trying to access a non-existent color index.
