Here's a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issue was due to incorrect handling of the `SOUNDS` section. The correct syntax requires you to specify sounds with a format index or upload them directly through the PuzzleScript editor, where they are assigned an index.

Here's the inline corrected code:

Currently, the game will not play sounds unless they are uploaded through the PuzzleScript editor, where you assign sound effects to specific actions or rules. In a text-based script, you specify sound effects by their index, assigned in the editor. You'd implement sounds through the PuzzleScript editor by uploading sound files or using existing ones and associating them with events like player movements or swaps.
