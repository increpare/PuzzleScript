To address the error message, we need to ensure that the number of cells on the left and right of the arrow `->` in each rule is the same. In the provided code, the rule `[ Player | Exit no Key ] -> [ Player | Exit_active ]` likely has some formatting issue causing this error. 

### Plan of Action
- Review the rule `[ Player | Exit no Key ] -> [ Player | Exit_active ]` for any discrepancies in cell counts.
- Make sure we update the cells on the right to match the cells on the left.
- Verify the code for any other potential syntax issues or misconfigurations.

After examining the rule, it's clear that the condition `no Key` does not directly translate to a cell in the desired rule format of PuzzleScript, since it acts as a condition rather than a unique cell. Thus, we interpret it within the context of how PuzzleScript typically worksâ€”it checks for the absence of an object using conditions rather than directly in the rule cells.

Let's correct this rule and provide a functioning version of the game code:

### Explanation:
- I've adjusted the rule parsing for PuzzleScript's environment by ensuring the rule checks appropriately for when there are no more keys (`[ no Key ]` as an additional line part of the rule, enforcing a condition on the matching step).
- The corrected rule now adheres to the syntax expectation of PuzzleScript and should eliminate the previous error, ensuring seamless compilation and functionality of the game logic.
