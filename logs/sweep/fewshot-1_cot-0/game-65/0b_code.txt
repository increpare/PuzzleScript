To design a new PuzzleScript game, I need to determine a theme or concept, establish the interactions between game elements, and then conceive the winning conditions and levels. Here's the plan:

1. **Theme**: I'll create a simple maze game where the player has to collect all keys to unlock the exit door, akin to a treasure hunt or key collection challenge.

2. **Objects**: I'll utilize basic elements such as walls, a player character, collectable keys, and an exit door.

3. **Legend**: Define the game symbols for ease of use in levels.

4. **Sounds**: Incorporate basic sounds for picking up keys and opening the exit.

5. **Collision Layers**: Detail which objects can move and interact, for instance, keys should be collectible, and walls should block movement.

6. **Rules**: Specify how the player interacts with keys and exits.

7. **Win Conditions**: The player must collect all keys to activate and pass through the exit.

8. **Levels**: Design multiple levels, each with increasing complexity.

Now, here's the complete code for a PuzzleScript game:

This game challenges players to think strategically about how to move and collect all keys before reaching the exit. Each level provides escalating difficulty to ensure engaging gameplay.
