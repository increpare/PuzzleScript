To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the problems and develop a plan of action:

1. **Wall Color Error**: The error messages indicate that the `Wall` object is trying to use colors from an undefined palette position. The code should ensure that colors are listed for each pixel in the 5x5 grid (25 colors).

2. **Sound Error**: The `SOUNDS` section seems to have incorrect definitions for sounds, which need to use verbs such as `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, etc., as the language requires sound events to utilize specific actions when a condition occurs. Modify sounds to use proper verbs.

3. **Rule Error**: The rules are supposed to check the player's interaction with keys and activate the exit only when all keys are collected. The rule `[ Exit | Player ] -> [ Exit | Player | Exit_active ]` doesn't have a valid equivalent transformation in the language. It should transform exit when a specific condition (like having all keys) is met.

Now, let's fix these in the code:

- Define the Wall object color correctly.
- Correctly define sound actions for the Key and Exit events.
- Ensure rules correctly reflect the desired game logic.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

### Key Corrections Made:
- **Wall Color**: Ensure each-level object layers configure correctly with the Wall object.
- **Sounds**: Use proper `CREATE` and `TRANSFORM` verbs for the Key and Exit sounds.
- **Rules & Win Conditions**: Implement logic where the player transforms the exit without keys, enabling the end game logic properly when all required conditions are met.
