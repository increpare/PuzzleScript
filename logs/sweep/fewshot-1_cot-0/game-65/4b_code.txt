The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code are due to the inclusion of English comments enclosed in semicolons, which is not the correct syntax for comments in the PuzzleScript language. In PuzzleScript, comments are wrapping in parentheses `()` or can be placed after a prime mark `'`. To fix these errors, I will replace the inline comments with the correct format. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

I've replaced the inline comments with properly formatted comments enclosed in parentheses. This should resolve the syntax errors and ensure the game compiles correctly.
