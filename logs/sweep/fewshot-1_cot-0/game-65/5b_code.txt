To address the compilation error, we need to ensure that in each rule, the patterns on the left-hand side (LHS) have a corresponding pattern of equal length on the right-hand side (RHS).

The error noted in line 86 means there is a mismatch in the length of patterns on the LHS and RHS. Upon reviewing the rules, we notice the rule responsible for transforming the exit when all keys are collected:

```plaintext
[ Player | Exit no Key ] -> [ Player | Exit_active ]
```

The current pattern describes a condition `[ Player | Exit no Key ]`, which involves two objects (`Player`, `Exit` with condition `no Key`). However, it translates to an RHS with only one object (`Player`) and a transformed `Exit_active`.

To resolve this:

1. Change the RHS pattern to ensure both positions (`Player` and `Exit`) are included in the transformation.

Here's the corrected code:

This corrected version maintains the same rule logic but ensures proper matching of patterns for successful compilation, resolving issues related to pattern mismatch in the rules.
