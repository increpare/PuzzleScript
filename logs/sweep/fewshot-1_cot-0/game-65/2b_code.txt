To resolve the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the issues one by one:

1. **Walls Color Issue:** The error indicates that the game is trying to access non-existent color options for the "Wall" object. In PuzzleScript, each object can have multiple colors for different parts of the sprite. The `Wall` object should have only one color since it does not define multiple colors. The color error will be resolved by using a single color in the `Wall` object's color definition.

2. **Sounds Error:** The errors at line 72 suggest incorrect use of the `SOUNDS` section. The syntax error is likely due to improper placement or definition of the sounds related to key creation or exit transformation. These should be linked to specific actions within the rules, such as a `CREATE` or `TRANSFORM` event. However, PuzzleScript has specific verbs like `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`, etc. We'll rethink the rules that trigger the sound to ensure sound effects are properly associated with game actions.

Let's apply these fixes in the code:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Wall Definition**: Updated the `Wall` object to define only one color.
- **Sound Events**: Proper sound events are added to action rules. The actions like picking up the key (`MOVE`) and transforming the exit (`TRANSFORM`) are now correctly associated with sound effects through the `SFX0` and `SFX1` triggers in the rule definitions.
- **Correct Storytelling**: The `SOUNDS` section must correctly convey which actions are associated with sounds.

This revised code should compile and run without producing the errors previously encountered.
