To address the errors present in the PuzzleScript code, follow these steps:

1. **Correct Level Map Definitions**: The current level maps include annotations like `# Level 1`, which are not valid within the level definition block. These annotations need to be removed.

2. **Ensure Rectangular Maps**: Each level must have rows of equal length. Verify that each row within a level has the same number of characters.

3. **Representation of 'CrateOnTarget'**: Ensure that 'CrateOnTarget' (`+`) will not conflict with other symbols or transformations.

Here's the corrected code with these changes applied:

### Explanation:

- **Removed Comments within Levels**: The comments (`# Level 1`, etc.) were causing parsing issues and have been removed.
- **Rectified Map Shapes**: Ensured maps are perfectly rectangular by checking character lengths per row.
  
This restructured code should compile and function correctly in PuzzleScript, providing a classic Sokoban style puzzle where players push crates onto targets.
