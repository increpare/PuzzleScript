Creating a PuzzleScript game involves defining objects, rules, win conditions, and levels. Here's a step-by-step plan to create a simple, yet complete game:

1. **Concept and Mechanics**: Let's design a simple Sokoban-like game where the player pushes crates onto targets. The objective is to cover all target tiles with crates.

2. **Objects**: We'll need a player, crates, walls, targets, and background.

3. **Rules**: The player should be able to push crates without walking through walls or other crates. The crates can't be pushed through walls.

4. **Win Condition**: Win when all crates are on targets.

5. **Levels**: Create a few levels of varying difficulty to demonstrate the game mechanics.

Now, I'll provide the complete code for this game:

### Explanation:

- **Objects**: Defined different objects like walls, player, crates, targets, and background with respective colors and patterns.
  
- **Legend**: Maps symbols to specific objects for easier level design.
  
- **Rules**: Specifies interactions. The player moves crates and crates on targets turn into a special object to track progress.

- **WinConditions**: The game is won when all target tiles (designated by `@`) are covered with crates (`+` representing a crate on a target).

- **Levels**: A few simple and progressively challenging levels.
