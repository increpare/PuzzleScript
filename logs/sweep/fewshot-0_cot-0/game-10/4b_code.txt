Sure! Here is your corrected PuzzleScript code with some changes to ensure that the game has solvable levels. The issue was likely due to crate movement logic in your levels which might not have been leaving them enough room to achieve the win condition. I've adjusted the levels accordingly:

I've ensured each level allows room for both the `Player` to move and `Crate` to be maneuvered into `Target` positions. This should allow for a valid solution path in all provided levels.
