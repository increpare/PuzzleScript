The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch between the length of patterns on the left and right sides of two rules. After reviewing the code, we observe that the errors occur because the incorrect rules try to transform one object directly into two objects (or vice versa) without tying their spatial arrangement properly, which is not allowed in PuzzleScript.

Here is a breakdown of the inappropriate rules:

1. **Finding Issue**: 
```plaintext
[ Crate | Target ] -> [ CrateOnTarget ]
[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player ]
```
The rules are expecting a spatial transformation between these objects, but if both 'Crate' and 'Target' are transformed to 'CrateOnTarget', or 'Player' moving to 'Target', they need to represent their spatial arrangement correctly.

2. **Correcting**: 
- For seamless transition:
  - When a 'Crate' is on a 'Target', it should transform into 'CrateOnTarget'.
  - The 'Player' can move onto a 'Target' without any transformation as it doesn't affect the target's existence but doesn't require explicit rule change according to the needs.

**Modified Rules**:
- Create transitions that allow for 'Crate' interaction over 'Target' and revert transformation during movement.

Here is the corrected code:

This revised code resolves the errors by ensuring spatial consistency in the rule definitions, aligning the left and right sides for transformations concerning crate movement and occupancy over targets.
