To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that for every rule, the pattern on the left (the 'before' state) is the same length as the pattern on the right (the 'after' state) in terms of the number of cells. 

Let's analyze the problematic rules:

1. `[ > Player | Crate | Target ] -> [ > Player | CrateOnTarget ]`

   The left side has three patterns: `Player`, `Crate`, and `Target`, while the right side only has two patterns: `Player` and `CrateOnTarget`. To correct it, we need to add a `Target` pattern on the right side so the replacement keeps the `Target` in the same location.

2. `[ > Player | CrateOnTarget ] -> [ > Player | Crate ]`

   The left side has two patterns: `Player` and `CrateOnTarget`, while the right side has only `Player` and `Crate`. The rule suggests that it might be checking directly if a `CrateOnTarget` is being pushed off a `Target`. So likewise, we should add a `Target` pattern on the right side, indicating that after moving the `CrateOnTarget`, the `Target` is still there underneath.

Let's apply these insights to the rules in question:

- For rule 1: `[ > Player | Crate | Target ] -> [ > Player | CrateOnTarget | Target ]`
- For rule 2: `[ > Player | CrateOnTarget ] -> [ > Player | Crate | Target ]`

Here's the repaired code:

These adjustments correct the errors by ensuring that the pattern structure and elements are the same on both sides of the rules.
