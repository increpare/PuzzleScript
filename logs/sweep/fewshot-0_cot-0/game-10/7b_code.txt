To fix the error in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the issue with the rule patterns that do not match in terms of length on the left and the right side of the rules. Specifically, the rules are not correctly structured based on the error message from line 87, which indicates a mismatch in the number of cells in the matching patterns on the left and right sides of the rules. Here's how we can fix these issues:

1. **Rule 1:** `[ > Player | Crate | Target ] -> [ > Player | CrateOnTarget | Target]`
   - The rule attempts to push a crate onto a target, converting it into a `CrateOnTarget`. The right side should not include the `Target` tile, as it should be consumed when the crate is moved. Thus, we update it to: `[ > Player | Crate | Target ] -> [ > Player | CrateOnTarget ]`

2. **Rule 2:** `[ > Player | CrateOnTarget | Target ] -> [ > Player | Crate | Target | ]`
   - This rule seems incorrect because it doesn't reflect the game's logic accurately. We typically wouldn't downgrade a `CrateOnTarget` back to a `Crate` when moved onto another `Target`. Instead, let’s re-phrase this rule to ensure it’s only reversing the effect in a context where it makes logical sense, similar as before: `[ > Player | CrateOnTarget ] -> [ > Player | Crate ]`

3. **Removing Incorrect Transition:** The rule `[ CrateOnTarget | Target ] -> [ CrateOnTarget | Target ]` seems problematic if taken by the error on line 87, suggesting an unnecessary duplication.

4. Fix any other rules involving targets and crates as needed and check they conform correctly to the game's intended operations.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

This fixed version eliminates leftover `'Target'` on the right side of rules, which resolves any length mismatch errors and adheres to the typical Sokoban mechanics.
