The errors reported by the console output indicate issues with the formatting of the PuzzleScript game code as well as potential issues with the sprite color configuration. Here's a breakdown of how to fix these errors:

1. **Line Formatting**: 
   - Ensure that each section header (like `Objects`, `Legend`, etc.) is followed directly by a new line, avoiding any inline comments. White spaces or anything mentioned after the section name on the same line are not allowed.

2. **Sprite Colors**:
   - It seems there is an issue with the color usage in the player sprite. PuzzleScript likely expects a binary pattern and you are specifying multiple color values. Adjust the color representation to match expected formatting rules.

3. **Legend and Section Headers**:
   - Similar to the `Objects` section, ensure no inline content exists after the section headers for `Legend`, `Sounds`, `CollisionLayers`, and `Rules`.

Here's the corrected code:

```plaintext
Title: PushBox

Objects:
player
  yellow
  .....

box
  brown
  .....

target
  green
  .....

wall
  grey
  .....

Legend:
  P = player
  B = box
  T = target
  W = wall

Sounds:

CollisionLayers:
  wall
  player
  box
  target

Rules:
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player | Target ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ Box | Target ]

WinConditions:
  All B on T

Levels:
#####
#.P.#
#.B.#
#.T.#
#####

######  
#..P.#  
#.B.##  
#.BT.#  
##.#### 
#.....# 
#######

#######
#..P..#
##B.B##
#..T..#
#######
```

**Explanation of Changes**:
- Removed sprite patterns for each sprite definition and kept just colors for simplicity since the reported issue was about color access. This allows the game to correctly identify the components as intended.
- Ensured section headers (like `Objects`, `Legend`, `Sounds`, etc.) are followed by the intended content only on new lines, adhering to the format rules.

This revised code should adhere to the conventional PuzzleScript structure and resolve the compilation issues previously mentioned.
