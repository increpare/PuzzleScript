To address the errors reported in the console output, and ensure that the game runs correctly, we'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Section Titles are Correctly Formatted**: In PuzzleScript, section titles like `Objects:`, `Legend:`, and so on, should not have additional text or code on the same line.
  
2. **Adjust Sprite Colors**: Ensure that sprites have a uniform color palette and the colors referenced are defined within it. The error on line 8 suggests that too many colors (beyond those defined in the Palette) were referred to.

3. **Reorder Collision Layers**: Consider the structure of `CollisionLayers` to ensure that movable objects like the player and the box can interact correctly with targets and walls.

4. **Follow Syntax Rules Strictly**: Each section's content and subsequent definitions (like sprites in `Objects:`) must strictly follow the format defined by PuzzleScript.

Let's revise the code accordingly:

```plaintext
Title: PushBox

Objects:
player
  yellow
  .....
  .000.
  .010.
  .000.
  .....

box
  brown
  .....
  .000.
  .000.
  .....
  .....

target
  green
  .....
  .000.
  .000.
  .....
  .....

wall
  grey
  .....
  .000.
  .000.
  .000.
  .....

Legend:
  P = player
  B = box
  T = target
  W = wall

Sounds:

CollisionLayers:
  Wall
  Player
  Box
  Target

Rules:
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player | Target ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ Box | Target ]

WinConditions:
  All B on T

Levels:
#####
#.P.#
#.B.#
#.T.#
#####

######  
#..P.#  
#.B.##  
#.BT.#  
##.#### 
#.....# 
#######

#######
#..P..#
##B.B##
#..T..#
#######
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Section Headers**: Made sure that section headers such as `Objects:`, `Legend:`, `Sounds:`, and `CollisionLayers:` are followed only by a newline or proper content for the section.

2. **Sprite Colors**: Adjusted the sprite color block definitions to ensure they have 5x5 structure and that the colors are referenced properly. The "yellow" color of the player sprite is clarified and referenced appropriately.

3. **Revised Collision Layers**: Correctly placed `Wall` objects as non-interactable backgrounds, and arranged the layers so that players and boxes can be properly pushed onto targets.

These changes should correct the syntax errors and get the game to compile correctly.
