The console output indicates that there are formatting errors in the game code where it expects each section name (like OBJECTS, LEGEND, SOUNDS, etc.) to be on a line by itself, followed by content on new lines. To fix these errors, we will ensure proper format by placing each section's title on a separate line and starting the relevant content on the next line. Additionally, we'll ensure that there are no formatting miscues or syntax errors in defining objects, rules, and win conditions. Here's the corrected code:

```plaintext
Title: PushBox

Objects:
player
  yellow
  .....

box
  brown
  .....

target
  green
  .....

wall
  grey
  .....

Legend:
  P = player
  B = box
  T = target
  W = wall

Sounds:

CollisionLayers:
  wall
  player
  box
  target

Rules:
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player | Target ]
[ Box | Target ] -> [ Box | Target ]

WinConditions:
  All B on T

Levels:
#####
#.P.#
#.B.#
#.T.#
#####

######  
#..P.#  
#.B.##  
#.BT.#  
##.#### 
#.....# 
#######

#######
#..P..#
##B.B##
#..T..#
#######
```

In this corrected version, each section header (like "Objects", "Legend", "CollisionLayers", etc.) is on its own line with the applicable content following it on new lines. This should resolve the formatting issues identified in the console output.
