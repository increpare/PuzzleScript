To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll follow a structured approach to ensure that all necessary components are included. The key components of a PuzzleScript game are:

1. **Title**: A name for the game.
2. **Author**: Information about who created the game.
3. **Homepage/Note**: Optional description or additional information about the game.
4. **Legend**: Definitions of all objects used in the game.
5. **Sounds**: (Optional) Definitions for sound effects.
6. **Collision Layers**: Organize objects into layers and handle interactions.
7. **Rules**: Define the interactions and behaviors of objects.
8. **Win Conditions**: Specify how the player wins the game.
9. **Levels**: Provide the maps where the game is played.

For this example, I'll design a simple Sokoban-style game where the player pushes boxes to target locations.

Here's the complete code for a basic Sokoban-style game in PuzzleScript:

```plaintext

legend
    . = Space
    @ = Player
    # = Wall
    $ = Box
    . = Target
    
    box = $ 
    target = . 
    wall = #
    player = @
    on_target = teller box on target

    # No sounds in this simple game.

**Breakdown of Game Components**:

1. **Title & Author**: Sets the identity of the game and who created it.
2. **Legend**: Maps shorthand symbols to object names. Objects include Player, Wall, Box, and Target.
3. **Collision Layers**: Determines how different object types are layered over one another, ensuring that the player and boxes can only be in designated layers.
4. **Rules**: Describe movement and interactions:
   - The player can move into empty spaces or push a box if there's space ahead.
5. **Win Conditions**: Specifies that all boxes must be on target spaces for the player to win.
6. **Levels**: The maps where the game is played. They consist of wall ('#'), target ('.'), player ('@'), and box ('$') placements.

With these elements, you have a complete, working Sokoban-style game in PuzzleScript. Adjust the level designs and potentially add more features like sound for a more robust gaming experience.
