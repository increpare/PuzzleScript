To repair the PuzzleScript code, we need to address several issues that arise due to syntax errors related to object declarations, legends, and other misconfigurations. Let's go through the issues step by step:

1. **Line 8 and Line 10 Errors:** The syntax is incorrect when defining the colors for objects. The correct format is `name CHAR color`, but it seems like the colors are specified incorrectly.

2. **Object Legend Redundancy:** Ensure there is no misuse or reuse of default characters in the legend definition, especially with "." which is used for both `background` and later as a `Wall` reference legend.

3. **Name Misuse:** There is an error regarding the use of `PLAYER` in the legend which is not pre-defined.

Here's how we can address these issues:

- Add space between the object name and character.
- Remove redundant or conflicting legend definitions.
- Ensure all defined objects in `objects` are declared correctly in the `legend`.

Here's the redesigned code:

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- Fixed the syntax of object definitions by ensuring there is a space between the object names and characters.
- Corrected the legend section to align it correctly with the object definitions.
- Kept the collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels intact since they did not have any syntax errors.

Now, this code should cleanly compile and run without errors.
