To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, the following issues must be addressed:

1. Define the objects section which is missing and is essential for setting up any game in PuzzleScript.
2. Correct the duplicated legend entry for the space and target by using different symbols.
3. Ensure all defined legend symbols are associated with their corresponding objects.

Below is a corrected version of the code with these changes addressed:

### Explanation:

- **Objects Section**: Added the `objects` section, which defines all entities used in the game including `Space`, `Player`, `Wall`, `Box`, and `Target`, assigning each a unique color.
  
- **Legend and Symbols**: Adjusted the legend for `Target` by using the symbol `t` to distinguish it from `Space` and corrected platform compatibility with the legends' declarations. Symbols in the legend must be unique and accurately reflect the mapping to objects.

- **Win Condition**: Corrected the win condition to reflect the renamed `Target` symbol 't'.

This structure adheres to PuzzleScript's requirements and should resolve the compilation errors.
