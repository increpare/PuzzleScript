To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's examine and adjust the problematic sections:

1. **Object Section Formatting**: Each object needs to be followed by a valid color hex code. The errors indicate that there's confusion about which line should be handling what object. Each object should be declared with proper spacing.

2. **Legend Overlaps**: The legend defines symbols that overlap with other definitions or leave gaps in object definition, leading to duplication errors. Ensure that each symbol represents only one object without conflicts.

3. **Ensure Rules Consistency**: Verify the player's symbol matches also in rules.

After addressing the above errors, the code should look like this:

### Corrections Made:

- **Spacing & Color Codes**: Ensured correct spacing follows each declaration with the appropriate color code.
- **Consistent Player Symbol**: Made sure that the Player symbol `P` is used consistently in the objects, legend, and rules sections.
- **Legend and Rules Clean-up**: Removed any ambiguities or overlaps in the legend and fixed the rules to properly represent the intended game mechanics.
- **Level Definition**: Correct the placement of the Player symbol (`P`) to match with the defined player. 

The repaired version should compile without errors and run the game as intended.
