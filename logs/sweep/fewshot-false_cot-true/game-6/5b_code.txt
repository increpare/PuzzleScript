To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to analyze each issue and correct them:

1. **Color Definition Error**: The error for the background object is due to misalignment. Each object should be clearly defined with its color in the `objects` section. Ensure each item, including its color, is placed correctly in the `objects` list without mismatched lines.

2. **Legend Issue**: This error arises because some objects are referenced both in definitions and legend as `.`. Each object must have a unique character representation in the `legend`.

3. **Undefined Objects**: The console reports an undefined `Player` in the `legend` section because the error stems from an incorrect order or incorrect syntax in the `objects` section.

Here's how these issues can be fixed:

- Properly align and define each object and their colors.
- Ensure no duplications or reuse of character representation in different contexts.

Here's the repaired code:

**Changes Made:**

- Corrected object definitions in `objects` to ensure all components are declared with proper colors.
- Updated the `legend`, using unique characters for each element ('P' for Player, 'W' for Wall, 'B' for Box, 'T' for Target).
- Adjusted the `levels` to match the corrected `legend` symbols.
