The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code stem from incorrect object definitions and legend assignments. Each object should have a distinct name and a corresponding color, and the legend should accurately map symbols to these objects.

Here’s a breakdown of the issues and corrections:

1. **Object Definitions**: Each object in the `objects` section should be defined with a unique name and a color:
   - Ensure that each line correctly associates a name with a color value.

2. **Legend Misalignments**: The legend should correctly relate each character to the respective object names defined under `objects`.

3. **Redundancy and Conflicts**: The symbol `.` is used twice in the legend which causes conflicts. Ensure that symbols are distinct and correctly mapped.

The following is a corrected version of the code:

Every object is defined with a distinct name and color, and the legend links them properly using unique symbols. The corrected version addresses the compilation errors and should now compile without errors.
