The errors in the console output indicate that there are issues with the way the color definitions are specified in the "objects" section. There are extra spaces that are incorrectly interpreted as part of the object name, leading to parsing errors. The objects section should follow a consistent format with the object name, symbol, and color.

Let's correct it by ensuring there are no extra spaces between the object's symbol and its color code. After cleaning up these issues, the color definitions and the entire "objects" section should be properly formatted.

Here’s the corrected PuzzleScript game code:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Objects Section:**
    - Corrected space formatting in the objects. Made sure there is a single space between the object name, its symbol, and the color code.

2. **Legend Adjustments:**
    - Adjusted the legend to correctly map symbols to object names without additional spaces. Also map the `.` symbol correctly to `background`.

3. **Collision Layers:**
    - Ensure the correct syntax without unnecessary capitalizations or spacing.
   
These changes should fix the parsing errors and allow the game to compile and run as expected.
