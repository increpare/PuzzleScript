To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's identify and fix them:

1. **Color Assignment Errors**: The error messages indicate an issue with color assignment. It seems there are incorrect spaces in object declarations, causing parsing issues.
2. **Duplicate Name in Legend**: There's an error indicating that "." is already in use, suggesting duplicate entries or incorrect parsing.
3. **Object Definition Missing**: The console output states that "PLAYER" is not defined anywhere, implying a potential parsing issue due to incorrect spacing or misnaming.

### Plan of Action
- Correct the object definitions by ensuring the correct spaces and format are used.
- Make sure each definition is on its line correctly to prevent misreading.
- Verify that all symbols in the legend match the object definitions.

Here is the corrected PuzzleScript code:

```

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted spacing and alignment in object definitions to ensure proper parsing.
- The levels section incorrectly used "@" in the rows, which isn't defined. It should be replaced by " " (space).
- Re-ensured that all elements are correctly identified in the legend according to the objects section.
  
These corrections should resolve the mentioned issues and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
