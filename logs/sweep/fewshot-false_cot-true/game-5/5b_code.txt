To address the errors, we need to ensure that each pattern on the left side of the rule has a corresponding pattern on the right side of equal length, as required by PuzzleScript. The errors are related to the rules involving `PlayerOnGoal`, `CrateOnGoal`, and `Goal`.

Currently, the rules:

```plaintext
[Player | Goal] -> [PlayerOnGoal]
[PlayerOnGoal] -> [Player]
[Crate | Goal] -> [CrateOnGoal]
[CrateOnGoal] -> [Crate]
```

are mismatched because the right side of the rule doesn't have a corresponding pattern for `Goal`. To fix these issues, we'll ensure that `Goal` remains in the pattern, as these rules are intended to toggle the state of the `Player` or `Crate` when they're on a `Goal`.

Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

This corrected code ensures that the `Goal` persists in each rule pattern, thus correcting the errors mentioned in the console output.
