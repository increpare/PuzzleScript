Certainly! Here is your PuzzleScript game code with some adjustments to ensure that at least one level is solvable. I've modified a level to give the player an opportunity to push a crate onto a goal.

I've amended Level 0 to ensure there is a path for the player to push the crate onto the goal. Please test it to verify the solvability. If further adjustments are needed or if you'd like more guidance on game design, feel free to ask!
