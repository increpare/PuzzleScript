The errors mentioned in the console output are likely due to comments in the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript does not support comments in the traditional way and treats anything outside of brackets or special keywords as terms or instructions, which leads to these compilation errors. Therefore, the plan of action is to remove any lines that are intended to be comments. The rest of the code appears to be correctly structured without syntax errors.

Let's revise the code:
- Remove any attempted comments from the `RULES` section. 

Here's the revised version of the game code:

This version addresses the issues by removing the inappropriate comments lines found in the `RULES` section. This should compile without generating errors related to unrecognized text or missing names.
