To create a complete PuzzleScript game, let's start by outlining the essential components needed:

1. **Objects**: Define the various objects that will be part of the game: player, walls, goals, and crates are common for a Sokoban-like puzzle as an example.

2. **Legend**: Connect symbols to the objects for ease of use in defining levels.

3. **Rules**: Set up game mechanics that establish how objects interact, especially the movement of the player and any pushing mechanics for crates.

4. **Win Condition**: Establish how a player wins, typically when crates cover all goals.

5. **Levels**: Design levels that offer a variety of challenges.

6. **Metadata**: Describe the game settings, like title and author.

We will create a simple Sokoban-esque PuzzleScript game. Here's how the components come together according to the above plan:

**Explanation:**

- **Objects**: Defined each game object with associated colors.
- **Legend**: Mapped each character to its respective object.
- **Collision Layers**: Set layers to control which objects can overlap or block each other.
- **Rules**: Defined movement controls and interactions for pushing crates and standing on goals.
- **Win Conditions**: Player wins when all crates are on goal tiles.
- **Levels**: Three simple layout levels are provided.

This setup should provide a complete and functional Sokoban-style puzzle game in PuzzleScript.
