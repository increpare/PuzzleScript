It looks like the main issue with your game is that in some levels, the crates are not initially positioned in a way that they can be moved into the goals, or the goals might not be reachable. Let's adjust the levels so that they are solvable.

Here, I changed the levels to ensure that each level now has a reachable path for the Player to move the Crate onto the Goal, thus making them solvable.
