To address the errors highlighted by the console output, we need to carefully examine the structure and syntax of the original PuzzleScript game code. Here's the plan:

1. **Error in Object Definitions**: The error at line 63 suggests there might be an issue with the pixel definitions of objects. Make sure all sprites are defined with 5x5 grids and that object names adhere to valid characters.

2. **Legend Definition Errors**: The error at line 73 suggests there's a syntax issue in the legend where `=` separators are missing. Ensure each piece in the legend has the correct assignment.

3. **Sound Section Detection**: There's a misunderstanding with the `SOUNDS` section, which should be included even if left empty. This error might be linked to incorrect formatting elsewhere.

4. **Collision Layer Configuration Issue**: The error states unexpected characters like `#` and incorrect objects added to layers. We need to verify that all objects referenced in COLLISIONLAYERS are correctly defined.

Let's fix these issues in the provided code:

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Adjusted Object Sprite for Box**: The Box sprite was incorrectly defined, missing symmetry across its grid. Corrected to `.000.` to maintain a valid 5x5 sprite format.
  
- **Correct Legand Definitions**: Revised legend section ensuring each item is correctly defined with a separator `=`.
  
- **Remove Incorrect Collision Layers**: Make sure the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section only includes declared objects.

The errors seem to have been primarily around incorrect syntax or formatting, which should be resolved with these changes.
