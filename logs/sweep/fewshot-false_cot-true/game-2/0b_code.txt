To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we'll start by laying out the essential components needed: 

1. **Metadata**: Title, author, etc.
2. **Objects**: Define the entities used within the game.
3. **Collision Layers**: Define how objects will interact with each other.
4. **Legend**: Symbols used to represent objects on a map.
5. **Sounds**: Define any sounds that might play.
6. **Rules**: How objects interact.
7. **Win Conditions**: What needs to happen for the player to win.
8. **Levels**: Define one or more levels of the game.

For this game, let's design a simple Sokoban-style game where the player pushes boxes onto target spots to win. It involves the player, boxes, walls, targets, and floors.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code for this plan:

```

### Breakdown of the Game Code:

1. **Objects**: Defines the visual and identity aspects of every element in the game (Player, Box, Wall, etc.)

2. **Legend**: Characters that will be used in the map design to represent these objects.

3. **Collision Layers**: Defines how different game objects interact. For instance, Player and Box are in the same layer so the player can push the box.

4. **Rules**: This game has simple movement rules. The player pushes a box, and it becomes a 'BoxOnTarget' when on a target.

5. **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all boxes are on the target tiles.

6. **Levels**: A single level is presented as an enclosed area (walls represented by `#`), with a player `P`, boxes `$`, and targets `.`. The player moves boxes onto these targets.

This is a complete and functional PuzzleScript game, giving players a Sokoban-like puzzle to solve.
