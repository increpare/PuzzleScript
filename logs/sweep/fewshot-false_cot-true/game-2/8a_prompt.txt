produced the following console output:
=================================
line 63 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 78 : Was expecting a sound event (like SFX3, or ENDLEVEL) or an object name, but didn't find either.
line 88 : section "WINCONDITIONS" is out of order, must follow  "RULES" (or it could be that the section "RULES"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 91 : incorrect format of win condition.
line 0 : Palette "0" not found, defaulting to arnecolors.
line 96 : Error, symbol " ", used in map, not found.
line 91 : Unwelcome term "define" found in win condition. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this.
line 55 : Object "FLOOR" has been defined, but not assigned to a layer.
line 76 : incorrect sound declaration.
