To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Background Sprite Error**: The current sprite for the `Background` object is using an unconventional start and end marker. In PuzzleScript, when defining sprites, they should be 5x5 grids of dots and 0s. The definition for the Background seems fine; however, be sure to check for invisible characters or misalignment.

2. **Legend Syntax Error**: The legend section is currently using dots (`.`) to define `Floor` but forgetting to include a sprite or object. The syntax for defining legends is to use an `=`. Therefore, the `LEGEND` items need to assign symbols to actual objects. It's likely the Floor definition is using the dot (`.`) without an object association.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Legend Fix:** The error `Incorrect format of legend` and similar messages were due to incorrect legend entries. These were corrected to `.= Floor` for the `LEGEND` section, ensuring each symbol is properly associated with an object.

Everything else was in order, so the mentioned changes should resolve the compilation issues. Make sure to recheck any invisible characters or misalignment which may have gone unnoticed initially, especially around the sprite definitions in the `OBJECTS` section.
