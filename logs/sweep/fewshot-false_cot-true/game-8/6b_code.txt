Certainly! The error message indicates that the initial level setup isn't allowing the player to solve the puzzle. To resolve this, I will adjust the level layout so the puzzle becomes solvable. Here is the corrected code:

In this layout, I ensured there are possible paths for the player to move the box onto the goal. The walls provide necessary boundaries for positioning, and there is enough space for the player to maneuver the box onto the goal square.
