The errors you're encountering are due to the use of semicolons to mark comments in the levels section. PuzzleScript does not support semicolon-prefixed comments in the levels part of the game definition. Instead, comments should be in the correct places, such as at the beginning of a new section, and not inline with level data.

Here's a plan of action:
1. Remove the comment marked by a semicolon in the levels section.
2. Ensure the level data is correctly formatted, using only the defined objects in the legend.

Here is a repaired version of the code:

This version of the code removes the comment from the levels section, thus resolving the compilation errors that were preventing your game from working correctly. As a result, the game should now compile and run properly with the supplied level data.
