Let's address the errors one by one:

1. **Color Palette Issue with Goal Sprite**: The sprite `Goal` is only defined with one color (`GREEN`), but the design appears to attempt referencing a second color, which doesn't exist. We either need to add a second color (even if unused paint it as green), or correct the design pattern to use just one color.

2. **Incorrect Section Order**: Sections must follow a particular order as per the PuzzleScript format. The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is out of order. The correct order, with all required sections including empty ones (such as `SOUNDS`), needs to be respected.

3. **Name Mismatch in Rules**: Names in rules are case-sensitive. The error suggests that the game engine is not recognizing `Player` and `Box` in the rules due to a capitalization differences.

Here is a corrected version of the game code:

**Changes Explanation**:
1. Added another color `GREEN` to the `Goal` object, maintaining the palette structure even though it isn't used by its design.
2. Inserted an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section.
3. Verified that names in the `RULES` section exactly match those defined in the `LEGEND` section, particularly correcting the case sensitivity (ensuring `Player` and `Box` in rules match their defined names).
