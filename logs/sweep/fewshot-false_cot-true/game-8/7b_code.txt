Certainly! The issue likely stems from the initial configuration of the elements and their positions in the level. Let's ensure that the game mechanics allow for the box to be pushed onto the goal. Here's a revised version of the code to make the level solvable:

In this revised layout, the Box (B) and Player (P) are aligned in such a way that the Player can push the Box onto the Goal (G) without being blocked by a Wall (#). This configuration ensures the level can be completed, thereby fixing the unsolvability error.
