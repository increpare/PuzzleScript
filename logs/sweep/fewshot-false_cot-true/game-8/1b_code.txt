The error messages indicate that there is an issue with color indexing in the `Player` and `Background` sprites. In PuzzleScript, each sprite is defined in a text-based grid where numbers correspond to the colors specified in the header of the sprite. Each color number should reference a color that is listed for the sprite.

Looking through the given script, the sprites have incomplete or incorrect color definitions:

1. The `Background` sprite only has the color `WHITE`, so it can't use any color index other than 0. The defined grid is trying to use color index 1 (which doesn't exist).
2. Similarly, the `Player` sprite is defined as `BLUE` but is trying to use color index 1, which isn't defined.

To fix the code, we need to:

- Adjust the sprite definitions to match the correct number of colors defined.
- Ensure the color grids use only the defined colors.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Here's what was changed:
- `Background` was updated to use only the color `WHITE`.
- `Box` was correctly defined to use `YELLOW` and `GREY`.
- `Goal` was correctly set to use just `GREEN`.
- Simplified the grid design in sprites as necessary to ensure colors are correctly referenced.
