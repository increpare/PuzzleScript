To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll need to define several key sections in the PuzzleScript language: 

1. **Objects:** Define the sprite characters that will be used in the game.
2. **Legend:** Assign characters from the grid to represent each object.
3. **CollisionLayers:** Define layers for objects that interact or collide with each other.
4. **Rules:** Specify the behavior and mechanics of the game through a series of rules.
5. **WinConditions:** Establish goals for players to achieve to win the game.
6. **Levels:** Design levels that players will engage with.

For this task, I'll create a simple Sokoban-style game where the player needs to push boxes onto goal tiles.

### Plan:

1. **Objects:** I'll define several objects including Player, Wall, Box, and Goal.
2. **Legend:** Assign characters to these objects to simplify level design.
3. **CollisionLayers:** Objects will be separated into layers based on their ability to occupy the same space (e.g., Player and Box can share a space with Goal).
4. **Rules:** I'll set up movement rules and interactions, particularly letting the Player push the Box.
5. **WinConditions:** The game will be won when all Boxes are on Goals.
6. **Levels:** Create a simple level to illustrate the mechanics.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code:

### Explanation:

- **Objects:** Defined using a 5x5 pixel grid to create a visible representation for the game elements.
- **Legend:** Simplified symbols to represent objects on the game grid.
- **CollisionLayers:** Ensures that object logic is applied correctly and represents possible interactions (Player moves or pushes the Box).
- **Rules:** Allow the Player to push the Box, and ensure Players can walk over Goals without altering game state.
- **WinConditions:** Set Boxes must be on Goal positions to win.
- **Levels:** Demonstrates gameplay mechanics in a manageable format.
