The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code seem to stem from the structure and arrangement of the sections like Legend, CollisionLayers, and Rules. It appears that the syntax is not being followed correctly according to standard PuzzleScript conventions. Also, the Legend section should define the pieces in a proper "'P' = Player" format.

Let's structure and correct the given code carefully:

1. **Legend Section**: Define each character with a correct mapping to their respective objects.
2. **CollisionLayers Section**: Use proper syntax to define what can collide with what.
3. **Rules Section**: Define movement rules with the correct syntax. Each rule should be explicit.
4. **WinConditions Section**: Should check for all boxes being on targets without errors.
5. **Levels Section**: Ensure the levels are correctly defined.

Here's a repaired version with corrected syntax:

```plaintext
[Objects]
player P
wall #
box B
target .
grass G

[CollisionLayers]
player, box
wall
grass

[Rules]
[right player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[left  player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[up    player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[down  player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]

[right player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[left  player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[up    player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[down  player | grass] -> [grass | player]

[WinConditions]
all box on target

[Levels]
;;;;level 1
#####
#P  #
#   #
#B  #
#.. #
#####
;;;;level 2
#######
#P   ##
# B. #
##   #
######

;;;;level 3
########
#P  #  #
# BB#..#
#  #   #
#  ### #
#      #
########
```

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Legend to Objects**: Changed the [Legend] section to [Objects] and ensured character definitions are properly mapped to object types.
2. **Rule Corrections**: Ensured each rule was properly formatted with the right number of components to indicate the transition after player movement.
3. **Checked CollisionLayers**: Specified the collision layers efficiently.
4. **WinConditions Syntax**: Lowercased the terms and ensured they match typical PuzzleScript syntax requirements.

These changes should resolve the compilation issues and improve the conformity of the script to the PuzzleScript standard.
