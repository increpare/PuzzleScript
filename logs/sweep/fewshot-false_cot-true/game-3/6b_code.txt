The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code are due to incorrect placement of the `[objects]` section and missing keywords. PuzzleScript does not require the `[objects]` section; instead, it requires the usage of `[objects_definitions]` to define color and appearance properties if needed, but for simplicity it usually just uses `[legend]` directly to define game objects.

Here are some specific issues and corresponding solutions:

1. The `[objects]` section is redundant/incorrect. Definitions need to be moved to `[legend]` for better syntax.
2. Ensure clear mapping of what character depicts which object within the `[legend]` section.
3. Re-evaluate the rules to remove any potential redundancy or errors although they look fine at a glance.
  
Given this understanding, here is the corrected version of the game code:

```plaintext
[Legend]
P = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
. = Target
G = Grass

[CollisionLayers]
Grass
Player, Box
Wall

[Rules]
[right Player | Box] -> [ | Player | Box]
[left  Player | Box] -> [ | Player | Box]
[up    Player | Box] -> [ | Player | Box]
[down  Player | Box] -> [ | Player | Box]

[right Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[left  Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[up    Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[down  Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]

[WinConditions]
All Box on Target

[Levels]
;;;;level 1
#####
#P  #
#   #
#B  #
#.. #
#####
;;;;level 2
#######
#P   ##
# B. #

######

;;;;level 3
########
#P  #  #
# BB#..#
#  #   #
#  ### #
#      #
########
```

The object definitions are removed from the `[objects]` section and properly included in the `[legend]`. The appearance of objects on the console is implicitly defined in the `[legend]` without needing an explicit `[objects]` section. This should eliminate the errors related to unrecognised elements in the prelude.
