The provided PuzzleScript code contains errors that are mainly associated with misplacement or improper use of prelude elements like `========`, `[objects]`, `[legend]`, `[collisionlayers]`, `[rules]`, `[winconditions]`, and `[levels]`. Here's a plan to fix the errors:

1. **Remove Extra Separators**: PuzzleScript uses multiple equal signs (`=`) as separators. Ensure you have only one section starting and ending with these lines.

2. **Correct Section Headers**: Each section should begin with its corresponding header enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Ensure that the objects, legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels are under the correct sections.

3. **Remove Colors and Names from Object Definitions**: PuzzleScript does not require color definitions or naming in `[objects]`. We should define objects directly with their sprite representation.

4. **Ensure Consistent Grammar**: Remove unnecessary equal signs at the start and end, as they don't conform to PuzzleScript syntax. 

5. **Validate Rules and Legend Sections**: Ensure that simple mapping of sprites and rules are correctly defined.

Here is the corrected code:

```plaintext
[objects]
Player P
Wall #
Box B
Target .
Grass G

[legend]
P = Player
# = Wall
B = Box
. = Target
G = Grass

[collisionlayers]
Grass
Player, Box
Wall

[rules]
[right Player | Box] -> [Player | Box]
[left  Player | Box] -> [Player | Box]
[up    Player | Box] -> [Player | Box]
[down  Player | Box] -> [Player | Box]

[right Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[left  Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[up    Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]
[down  Player | Grass] -> [Grass  | Player]

[winconditions]
All Box on Target

[levels]
;;;;level 1
#####
#P  #
#   #
#B  #
#.. #
#####
;;;;level 2
#######
#P   ##
# B. #
##   #
######

;;;;level 3
########
#P  #  #
# BB#..#
#  #   #
#  ### #
#      #
########
```

This code should now compile correctly as it follows the rules and structure of the PuzzleScript language.
