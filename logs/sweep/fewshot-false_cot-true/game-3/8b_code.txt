The errors in the console indicate issues with the sections of the code that don't align with the expected structure of a PuzzleScript game. The unrecognised "stuff in the prelude" suggests there's a problem with the core sections of the script, namely `[Objects]` and `[CollisionLayers]` which are mislabeled, as the correct labels are `[Objects]` and `[Legend]` followed by `[CollisionLayers]`.

Additionally, `[Legend]` maps characters to objects or combinations, which should be rectified for each character to ensure PuzzleScript knows what each character in the level maps to.

Here's how the corrected code should look:

```plaintext
[Objects]
player
wall
box
target
grass

[Legend]
P = player
# = wall
B = box
. = target
G = grass

[CollisionLayers]
player, box
wall
grass

[Rules]
[right player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[left  player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[up    player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]
[down  player | box | ] -> [ | player | box]

[right player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[left  player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[up    player | grass] -> [grass | player]
[down  player | grass] -> [grass | player]

[WinConditions]
All box on target

### Changes made:

1. **Section Headers**: Corrected `[Objects]` to match correctly with `[Legend]`, defining sprite names and their corresponding symbols.
2. **`[Legend]` Section**: Added the `[Legend]` section to map characters to object names.
3. **WinCondition Correction**: Ensure "all" is capitalized to align with the PuzzleScript syntax: `All box on target`.

These changes should resolve the unrecognised errors and allow the game to compile and operate correctly.
