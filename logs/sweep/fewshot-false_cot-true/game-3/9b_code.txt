The errors you are encountering are due to the incorrect definition of the Objects section. In a correct PuzzleScript game definition, the "Objects" section should consist of an object name followed optionally by its color or appearance specification. There should be no empty lines between sections or within a section if possible, as PuzzleScript expects a specific format.

Also, collision layers have to strictly separate different interaction rules. In this code, "grass" is placed in its own layer but does not necessarily need to be separated if it doesn't interrupt player movement.

The Legends section is correctly defined, and rules are correctly designed. However, an additional object sprites definition is missing in the Objects section. Here's the corrected code:

This code corrects the errors by specifying the color or appearance for each object, following the proper format in the Objects section. The rules and levels remain unchanged since they were originally correct.
