The provided PuzzleScript code has some issues that are causing errors. These errors are related to the use of pre-defined sections: `# [objects]`, `# [legend]`, etc. In PuzzleScript, sections are indicated with brackets but should not include hash `#` signs. Also, defined Objects in [objects] section should match with the legend.

Let's correct these errors:

1. Remove hash signs `#` from section headers and use `=` for separating these sections.
2. Ensure that `Wall` and `Target` in the `[legend]` section match with objects definitions.
3. Background in the `[collisionlayers]` should not be used unless specifically defined.
4. Save correct `Wall`, `Box`, `Target` and `Grass` color.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

I have made the necessary corrections by adjusting the sections, and fixing the `[legend]` and `[collisionlayers]`. Please try this updated code.
