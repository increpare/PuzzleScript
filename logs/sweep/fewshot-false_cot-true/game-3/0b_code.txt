To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Game Concept**: Decide on a simple concept suitable for PuzzleScript. A classic choice is a Sokoban-like puzzle where a player pushes boxes onto target goals.

2. **Title and Author**: Specify the game's title and author details.

3. **Objects**: Define game elements such as the player, walls, boxes, and targets.

4. **Legend**: Set up how objects behave and interact on the grid.

5. **Collision Layers**: Determine interactions, ensuring immovable objects don't overlap with moveable ones incorrectly.

6. **Rules**: Write rules that govern interactions, like moving and pushing boxes.

7. **Win Conditions**: Establish conditions for winning the level, e.g., all boxes on targets.

8. **Levels**: Design a few levels to showcase the game mechanics.

Following this outline, here's the complete PuzzleScript game code:

### Commentary:
- **Game Concept**: The game borrows from Sokoban where players push boxes onto targets.
- **Objects**: Defined using color and symbol associations.
- **Rules**: Specify player movements and box pushing.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all boxes are on target locations.
- **Levels**: Three initial levels are designed, gradually increasing in complexity.

This code sets up a basic but complete PuzzleScript game that demonstrates fundamental mechanics and allows for potential expansion with more levels or rules.
