To create a complete PuzzleScript game, let's outline the main components that need to be defined:

1. **Title**: Every game needs a name.
2. **Objects**: Define the graphics and colors of all pieces in the game.
3. **Legend**: Create symbolic letters representing each object.
4. **Sokoban-style behavior**: This is a common type of game, where the player pushes boxes to goals.
5. **Sounds**: Optional but can be included for actions like moving or winning.
6. **Rules**: Define how objects interact, such as how the player and boxes move.
7. **Win Condition**: Define how the player wins, typically when all goals are covered by boxes.
8. **Levels**: Design one or more levels to be solved.

I will create a simple Sokoban-style game where the player must push boxes onto goals.

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: Define basic game pieces with simple 5x5 pixel graphics using hexadecimal colors.
- **Legend**: Symbols like `P`, `B`, and `G` are used to represent objects like Player, Box, and Goal.
- **Rules**: Player pushes boxes to get them on goals. Boxes can sit on goals and carrots indicate new goals. Custom rules ensure that when a box is pushed onto a goal, it transforms into another object (`BoxOnGoal`).
- **Win Condition**: The game checks if all goals are covered.
- **Levels**: Define grid layouts that represent a level using pre-defined symbols.

This simple code demonstrates setting up a fundamental Sokoban puzzle with basic mechanics. You can expand this by adding more levels, sounds, or even new mechanics to diversify the gameplay.
