To resolve the issues in the given PuzzleScript game code, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Check Object Definitions**: Ensure that each object sprite is 5x5 pixels exactly. The current sprites appear to be correct in size, so this part seems already fixed.

2. **Review Legend Syntax**: Ensure that each item definition in the legend section uses the correct syntax. There seems to be an error hinting at an incorrect line, but visually, this looks correct. However, we'll ensure clarity and correctness in this section.

3. **Collision Layers**: The compilation error messages suggest something is misplaced. The collision layer's definition should follow the correct section order as per PuzzleScript standards. 

4. **Include Empty Sound Definition**: It appears the error message is looking for a "SOUNDS" section, so we'll include it, even though it's empty.

5. **Fix Possible Formatting and Typos**: Double-check and rectify any possible typos or formatting inconsistencies.

The revised code will contain these fixes and should compile without errors:

The code above includes a fix by adding an empty "sounds" section and reordering the sections correctly. This should resolve the compilation errors related to section ordering and missing sections.
