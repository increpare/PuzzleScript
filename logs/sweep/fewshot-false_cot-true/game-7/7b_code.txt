To address the errors, let's carefully examine the existing code and correct where necessary. Here are the main steps I will follow:

1. **Line 36 Error**: The console mentions issues with the object section, specifically mentioning the object representation. Let's ensure all objects have correctly formatted sprite data. Each should be a 5x5 grid with dots and zeros as placeholders for pixels.

2. **Line 44 Error**: The console reports issues with the legend section. This is usually caused by incorrect syntax. The legend entries should map a single-letter symbol to an object name using proper syntax (e.g., `A = B`).

3. **Line 47 Error**: Despite it being okay to have an empty `sounds` section, we'll ensure its format is correct. A correctly formatted but empty `sounds` section should help avoid this error.

4. **Line 53 Error**: There is likely a misinterpretation of comments or a malformed section. Ensure that sections such as `collisionlayers` are correctly formatted without extraneous text or characters.

5. **General Structural Checks**: Verify that all sections are correctly defined and formatted according to the PuzzleScript language specifications.

Let's now fix the code:

**Fixed issues:**
- Ensured that object representations are consistently 5x5.
- Corrected the legend definitions to match the required format.
- Maintained an explicitly empty `sounds` section for clarity.
- Ensured proper use of the `collisionlayers` and other formatting throughout the script.
