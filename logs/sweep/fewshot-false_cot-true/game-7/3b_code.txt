The error messages indicate that there is a problem with the "palette" section of the PuzzleScript game code. PuzzleScript does not use a "palette" section; instead, colors are often directly associated with objects. The issue arises because the game engine does not recognize the keywords for the color palette.

To fix this, we will remove the "palette" section entirely and ensure that the correct colors are applied to the objects in the `objects` section by associating colors with the objects using their RGB or hex color codes if supported, or relying on assigned colors through shapes and letting the engine handle visibility and differentiation.

Here's the revised version of the code:

### Notes:
- Removed the "palette" section since PuzzleScript does not support it.
- Added colors directly to the objects using hex color codes within objects section which is the common practice in some custom engines or visually discerning objects more clearly by shape directly,
- Checked the rules and level to make sure boxes can be pushed correctly, and wins are correctly detected as per levels.
