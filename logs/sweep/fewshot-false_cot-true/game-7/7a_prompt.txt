produced the following console output:
=================================
line 36 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 44 : In the legend, define new items using the equals symbol - declarations must look like "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]".
line 44 : Incorrect format of legend - should be one of "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]", but it looks like you have a dangling "ERROR"?
line 47 : Was expecting a sound event (like SFX3, or ENDLEVEL) or an object name, but didn't find either.
line 53 : error detected - unexpected character #
line 53 : Cannot add "DEFINE" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
line 53 : Cannot add "HOW" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
line 53 : Cannot add "THE" to a collision layer; it has not been declared.
