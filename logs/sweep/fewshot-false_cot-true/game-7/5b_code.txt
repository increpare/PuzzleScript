To address the compilation errors, we need to follow the constraints and structure of the PuzzleScript language closely. Let's tackle each issue in the provided code:

1. **Sprite Size and Naming Convention Error:** All object sprites need to be 5x5 pixels. The error on line 36 might suggest a misunderstanding in object definition, but upon inspection, the sprite definitions are correct. However, ensure the characters used for object names (like "BoxOnGoal") and legend symbols (like "B", "P") follow basic naming rules (though they do).

2. **Legend Section Issue:** The error on line 44 suggests a formatting issue. Ensure that the legend assignments are done using valid identifiers and follow the structure.

3. **Section Order and Missing Section Error:** The 'COLLISIONLAYERS' section is obligatory and determines how objects can interact. It's missing in the original code, causing the 'RULES' section to be out of order.

4. **Undefined Object References in Rules:** The "Player", "Box", and other objects' names are case-sensitive and need to be exactly as defined in the 'objects' section, ensuring there's no mismatch.

5. **Win Conditions Might Be Incorrectly Defined:** Make sure that the win condition logically represents the game's objective.

Here's a repaired version of the code, addressing all issues above:

  [ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
  [ Box | Goal ] -> [ BoxOnGoal ]
  [ BoxOnGoal | Player ] -> [ Player | BoxOnGoal ]
  [ Player | BoxOnGoal ] -> [ > Player | Goal ]

# Define how a player wins the level

  All BoxOnGoal on Goal

# Create one or more levels

```

### Key Adjustments Made:
- Added the `collisionlayers` section to define object interaction layers.
- Ensured object references are consistent and case-sensitive between definitions, rules, and the legend.
- Checked and preserved sprite dimensions and legend symbols. 

This version should compile successfully and run as intended, representing a basic Sokoban game.
