The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code stem from multiple issues: problems with the sprite matrix definition size, case-sensitivity in object names, and logical pitfalls related to how rules are specified for object transformations. Let me address these one by one:

1. **Sprite Matrix Definition:** The PuzzleScript requires sprite matrices to be exactly 5x5 in dimensions. The error messages indicate issues with the provided sprite matrix lines due to the improper representation of graphic details.

2. **Case Sensitivity:** PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. Hence, object names like `Box` and `BoxOnGoal` should consistently match their references in rules and elsewhere, which is the root of some errors.

3. **Transformation Rules:** The transformation from `Box` to `BoxOnGoal` and regarding reset should ensure consistency with the win condition.

Here is the corrected game code, addressing these issues:

```

Explanation:
- Corrected sprite matrices for `Player`, `Box`, `Goal`, and `BoxOnGoal` are now exactly 5x5.
- Ensured consistent naming by modifying all instances of `Box` and `BoxOnGoal` with exact matches in the rule sets and other references. This removes case-sensitivity issues.
- The rules and win condition are left unchanged, keeping the interactions logical and consistent with the game's basic goal.
