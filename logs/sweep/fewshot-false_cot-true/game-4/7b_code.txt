The error messages indicate that there are issues with the color definitions for the objects. The console output is showing confusion; it appears that we have some overlapping names. Specifically, it seems that multiline data might be causing parts of lines to be misinterpreted as colors.

In PuzzleScript, errors related to "Was looking for color" often result from failing to properly separate object definitions. Each object should be defined on a new line, with its color following precisely after its name without any stray characters or spaces to disrupt parsing.

Here's a plan to fix the code:

1. Ensure that each object is defined on its own line, each with an object name followed by its color.
2. Verify that there are no extraneous spaces or characters.
3. Double-check if all specified colors are correct according to the syntax.

After observing these issues, the corrected code would look like this:

```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK
Wall        W GRAY
Player      P BLUE
Block       B RED
Goal        G GREEN
BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

Each object and its color are clearly defined on separate lines, with proper spacing between them. This should resolve the parsing issues indicated by the error messages.
