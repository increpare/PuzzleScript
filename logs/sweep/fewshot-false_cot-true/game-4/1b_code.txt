To address the compilation errors and produce a functioning PuzzleScript game, we need to resolve the following issues:

1. **Metadata Error:** The `homepage` metadata line must have a value or be removed if not needed.
2. **Color Specification Errors:** Each object must be assigned a color definition in the `objects` section. The errors indicate missing or incorrect color assignments for `Background`, `Player`, and `Goal` objects.

To fix these, we will:
- Remove the `homepage` line or assign it a placeholder URL.
- Add color definitions to each object in the `objects` section.

Here's the corrected game code:

```plaintext
========
title SokobanPuzzle
author Your Name
========

========
objects
========
Background . BackgroundColor
Wall W WallColor
Player P PlayerColor
Block B BlockColor
Goal G GoalColor
BlockOnGoal O BlockOnGoalColor

========

. = Background
W = Wall
P = Player
B = Block
G = Goal
O = BlockOnGoal

[ BlockOnGoal | Goal ] -> [ BlockOnGoal ]

```

Assign appropriate colors to each of the objects like this, for instance:
```plaintext
BackgroundColor BLACK
WallColor GRAY
PlayerColor BLUE
BlockColor RED
GoalColor GREEN
BlockOnGoalColor YELLOW
```

The corrected objects section would look like this:
```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK
Wall W GRAY
Player P BLUE
Block B RED
Goal G GREEN
BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

Implement these color definitions to the `objects` section as needed. Adjust the color names to suit your specific visual preferences for the game.
