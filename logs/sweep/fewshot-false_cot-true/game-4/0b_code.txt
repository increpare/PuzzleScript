To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we must specify several key components in the game's code: 

1. **Objects**: These define the different elements in the game, such as the player, walls, goals, and other interactive items.
2. **Legend**: This maps the characters used in the level to the objects defined.
3. **Sounds**: Optional but can enhance the game experience.
4. **CollisionLayers**: Organize how objects interact with each other.
5. **Rules**: The logic that defines how objects behave and interact.
6. **WinConditions**: Specify what needs to happen to win the game.
7. **Levels**: The design layout of the game levels.

Given these components, I'll design a simple Sokoban-like game where the goal is to push blocks to target locations.

Here's the plan for the game:
- **Player (P)**: The character controlled by the player.
- **Wall (W)**: Blocks the player's path.
- **Block (B)**: The object that can be pushed by the player.
- **Goal (G)**: The target location for the blocks.
- **Block on Goal (O)**: Represents a block placed on a goal.
- **Ground (.)**: Empty space where the player and blocks can move.

The win condition will be when all blocks are placed on the goals.

Now, let's write the complete PuzzleScript code:

In this simple Sokoban game:
- There are a few levels demonstrating different layouts and challenges.
- Each puzzle must have all blocks placed on their respective goals for the player to win.
- The rules handle movement and conversions between blocks and blocks-on-goal.
