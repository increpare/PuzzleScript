The errors seem to indicate that the parser is not correctly identifying lines due to an issue with whitespace placement in the `objects` section. The PuzzleScript language requires a specific format for defining objects, where typically, each object is defined on a single line with no unnecessary spaces between the object name, character, and color.

Let's outline the observed issues and corrections needed:
- Ensure that each object definition line in the `objects` section follows the standard format: `ObjectName Character Color`. 
- Remove excessive spaces between parts of an object's definition.

Here's a corrected version of the code that addresses the errors:

```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK
Wall W GRAY
Player P BLUE
Block B RED
Goal G GREEN
BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

In this corrected code:
- Each object line uses a single space between object properties (`name`, `character`, and `color`).
- The `objects` section headers and declarations are intact, ensuring that the PuzzleScript parser should correctly interpret the game objects.
