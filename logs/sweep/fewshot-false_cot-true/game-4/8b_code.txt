The errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code are related to whitespace management between identifiers and colors. The error messages indicate that the parser is having trouble identifying color assignments due to incorrect formatting. PuzzleScript requires that there's a single space between the object name and its color code. Multiple spaces or tabs may disrupt correct parsing of the code. 

My plan is to ensure that each object is consistently followed by one space before its associated color. This will resolve the formatting issues causing the compilation errors.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK
Wall W GRAY
Player P BLUE
Block B RED
Goal G GREEN
BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

I've made sure that there is exactly one space between each object identifier and its color specification. This should address the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
