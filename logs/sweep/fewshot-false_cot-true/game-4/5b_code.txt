The errors in your PuzzleScript game code indicate a mismatch between the defined colors and the object names. Each object line seems to contain some extra whitespace, which is causing the interpreter to misread the object descriptions. The general format should be consistent and concise, so ensuring no unnecessary spaces or tabs are present is crucial.

Additionally, PuzzleScript is sensitive to the length of lines and the presence of any characters that don't conform to its syntax expectations, so it's best to format each object line uniformly. 

Here's a plan to repair the code:
1. Ensure that the whitespace between the object names and their abbreviations is uniform (usually a single space before and after the abbreviation), and adjust any inconsistencies in spacing.
2. Verify that each object conforms to `ObjectName Abbreviation Color` without additional spaces or extraneous characters.
3. Ensure there are no additional or missing lines, comments, or characters that may interfere with the parsing.

Here's the corrected game code:

```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK
Wall       W GRAY
Player     P BLUE
Block      B RED
Goal       G GREEN
BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

This corrected version should resolve the errors by ensuring the syntax is clear and properly formatted for each object definition.
