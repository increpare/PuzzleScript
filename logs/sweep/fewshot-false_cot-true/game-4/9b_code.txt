The errors in the console output suggest that the parser is confused by the placement of object definitions in the section. In PuzzleScript, object definitions must be separated by a single blank line between each group of object representations. This is likely a whitespace issue where the parser treats these as one long unbroken sequence due to missing blank lines. Also, ensure that there aren't any unintentional extra spaces or formatting issues that the parser interprets incorrectly. 

Here’s a corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
========
objects
========
Background . BLACK

Wall W GRAY

Player P BLUE

Block B RED

Goal G GREEN

BlockOnGoal O YELLOW
```

Each object definition is now separated by a blank line, adhering to the PuzzleScript format more strictly. This should resolve the errors that were causing the compilation to fail.
