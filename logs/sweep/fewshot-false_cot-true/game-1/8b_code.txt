The issue in the provided code stems from the fact that PuzzleScript does not recognize the `OBJECT` keyword and `color` or pixel art definitions in that format. Instead, PuzzleScript has its own syntax wherein objects are defined directly with their colors and pixels within the "objects" section, rather than using a block for declaration as seen in the code snippet you've provided.

Here's how we can correct it:

1. The correct syntax for defining objects involves placing the object definitions directly within the `OBJECTS` section.
2. Each object should begin on a new line with its name, optionally followed by a color, and then the pixel art.
3. Simplify the `PUSH` rules by using just movement conditions and automatic updates inside the `RULES` section for converting a `Box` to `CrateOnGoal`.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

I corrected the object definitions to align with the PuzzleScript standard format. The `sounds` section was left empty because while `PUSH` was initially mentioned, it requires sound definitions that aren't provided in your code snippet. The player actions automatically leverage the rule updates provided.
