To address the errors shown, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding regarding the sections of the PuzzleScript. The errors mention issues within the `# Objects` section, which suggests there might have been formatting issues with defining objects.

Upon reviewing the code, here's a potential plan of action:
1. Ensure each object is defined with the correct syntax.
2. Re-evaluate object definitions, especially checking color codes that follow the object name, and ensure there are no missing components or misplacements.
3. Ensure the pixel art for objects is aligned properly within a grid of 5x5 ASCII characters.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

Key Changes:
- Corrected the `# Collisions` section header line; it was unnecessary for the code provided and added an empty line to remove it.
- Made sure legends were consistently defined, following PuzzleScript conventions.
- Rearranged `# Legends` mapping for consistency with standard conventions in PuzzleScript.

This version should resolve the reported errors related to the 'Unrecognised stuff' in the objects' definition lines. Make sure objects have a valid ASCII art scheme and to follow the correct layout.
