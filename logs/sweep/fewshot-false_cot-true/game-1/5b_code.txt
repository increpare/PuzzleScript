The issue in the provided code is located in the "Objects" section. PuzzleScript requires object definitions to begin with the keyword `OBJECT` followed by the object name. Additionally, each object needs color and a sprite grid with dots and numbers representing their appearance.

The errors you see are likely because the code does not adhere to the required syntax for defining objects. Let's correct the syntax by following the PuzzleScript guidelines for object declaration.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Changes Made:
1. Added the `OBJECT` keyword before each object name.
2. Provided the `color` keyword to indicate the color for each object.
This should solve the syntax errors regarding object definitions and allow the code to compile without errors.
