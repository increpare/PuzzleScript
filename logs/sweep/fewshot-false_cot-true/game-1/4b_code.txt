The error messages in the provided PuzzleScript code suggest that there are unrecognized elements or formatting issues within the prelude section. In PuzzleScript, the prelude should include valid components such as title, author, and more, but excessive or incorrect entries can cause parsing errors.

Upon review, it appears that the problem is due to the structure of the object definition section. In PuzzleScript, each object requires a distinct object declaration keyword (e.g., `Object`) before its name to differentiate it from other parts of the script. 

Here's a repaired version of the code:

```

In this corrected version, each object is defined with the `Object` keyword followed by the object name, which resolves the unrecognized stuff error in the prelude section. This should prevent the parsing errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
