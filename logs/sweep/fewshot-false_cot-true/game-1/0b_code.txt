To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several key components: 
1. **Title and Author**: Basic metadata about the game.
2. **Objects**: The entities that exist in the game world.
3. **Legends**: Shortcuts or groupings for objects to simplify level design and rules.
4. **Sounds**: Define any sounds that should be associated with in-game events.
5. **Collision Layers**: Layers that define which objects can overlap.
6. **Rules**: Game mechanics that describe how objects interact or change state.
7. **Win Conditions**: Conditions to satisfy to win the level.
8. **Levels**: The actual maps or puzzles the player will interact with.

With these elements in mind, let's create a simple Sokoban-like game. In this game, the player pushes boxes onto goals to win.

Here's the complete code:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined with ASCII-style art and color for visualization. The player, box, wall, goal, and the new state "CrateOnGoal" (when a box is on a goal).
- **Collision Layers**: Established to determine that boxes and crate-on-goals cannot overlap, ensuring clear rules for player movement.
- **Rules**: Basic Sokoban mechanics—push a box, if a box lands on a goal, it becomes a "CrateOnGoal".
- **Win Condition**: The player wins when all boxes are correctly positioned on goals, thus becoming "CrateOnGoal".
- **Levels**: A simple level to illustrate the gameplay, showcasing the interaction between the player, movable boxes, and stationary goals.

This simple game lays the groundwork for expanding into more complex puzzles by adding more walls, boxes, and goals in different configurations.
