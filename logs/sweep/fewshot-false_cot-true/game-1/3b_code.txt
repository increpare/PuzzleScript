Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems the error messages relate to the attempted specification of object color and ASCII art in an unsupported format within the "Objects" section. The error arises because PuzzleScript expects each object definition to be preceded by a color declaration and a 5x5 grid design, defined on separate lines.

To fix these errors, the steps are to ensure that the object sections strictly adhere to the PuzzleScript format. Specifically:

1. Ensure each object name is followed by a color on a new line.
2. Verify each object's sprite is a 5x5 grid following the color declaration.

Here is the repaired code:

In this corrected version, I ensured the syntax for object definitions is correct, each object has a color declaration line, and I included a Legend for `CrateOnGoal` symbolized by `C` in case it is utilized in your levels (though it's not immediately used in the level presented). This should resolve the issues you were encountering with the original code block.
