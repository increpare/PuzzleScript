To address the error messages in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to review the location referenced in the errors. The error messages indicate issues in the "Objects" section from lines 9 to 14. It seems the errors occur due to the extraction of object definitions that do not adhere to correct formatting standards used in PuzzleScript.

The most likely cause for the errors is the incorrect formatting of object definitions, specifically the naming, color, and sprite definitions that don't align with the standard syntax.

Let's review the potential issues:

1. Each object is defined with the keyword `OBJECT` followed by the name.
2. The `color` must be written correctly with `=` to assign the color to the object.
3. Object pixel art needs to be formatted as a well-defined grid of characters (though the dimensions shown seem fine).

Let's correct and rewrite the code with these in mind:

In this version, I've removed the `OBJECT` keyword from each object definition according to the typical formatting style of PuzzleScript code, and the `color` assignment is properly formatted and consistently structured across objects. This should address the "unrecognised stuff" errors in the script.
