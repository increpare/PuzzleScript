The provided code contains errors in the object definitions due to the graphic representation formats. In PuzzleScript, each object's graphic representation must be defined using 5 lines of 5 characters, where each character should either be a number from '0' (representing transparency) to '9' (representing opacity and color intensity). I’ll correct these errors by replacing graphics with five 5-character lines of '0's or '1's for simplicity.

Additionally, the COLLISIONLAYERS section lacks structure and proper layer overlaps. I will also simplify this part to make sure it works correctly.

Let's reconstruct the game code properly:

In this corrected version, I've ensured that:
1. Each object has a specified visual with the correct 5x5 format.
2. The collisions layer does not conflict with game mechanics and is simplified.
3. The win condition specifies "Some" which is likely correct in the Sokoban context since you're supposed to place boxes on goals and not care about other goals.

This should resolve the compilation errors you were facing and result in a functional PuzzleScript game code.
