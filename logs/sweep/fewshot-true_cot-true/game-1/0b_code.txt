To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to follow these essential steps:

1. Conceptualize: Decide on a game concept. A simple puzzle game like Sokoban or block-pushing game is a good start.

2. Design Objects: Define the objects needed for the game such as player, walls, targets, and movable blocks.

3. Create Rules: Determine the rules that dictate how objects interact.

4. Set Win Conditions: Specify what it takes for the player to win the game.

5. Design Levels: Create at least one level to demonstrate the gameplay.

6. Ensure Completeness: Make sure the code includes all necessary parts so that it runs without errors.

Given these steps, I'll create a simple Sokoban-like block-pushing game where the player must push blocks onto target locations to win. Let’s proceed with implementing the code.

### Explanation:
- **Concept**: The player navigates a maze and pushes blocks onto target locations (similar to Sokoban).
- **Objects**: Player, blocks, walls, and targets are defined with distinct colors and patterns for clarity.
- **Rules**: The player can push blocks into empty spaces or targets. Blocks transform into a different object (`BlockOnTarget`) when on a target.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all targets are covered by blocks.
- **Level Design**: A single level is created with a player, blocks, targets, and walls to illustrate basic gameplay. 

This setup provides a complete gameplay experience in PuzzleScript.
