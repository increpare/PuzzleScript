The errors in the console output are related to incorrect color definitions in the sprite patterns for "Wall", "Target", and "BlockOnTarget". 

Here’s a walkthrough of how to fix these:

1. **Wall**: The pattern for "Wall" mentions three different color numbers but only defines one color (Grey). To fix this, ensure that the five-character-wide pattern only references color number 0 (Grey).

2. **Target**: Similar to "Wall," the "BlockOnTarget" definition uses a five-character-wide pattern that tries to access a color number that hasn't been set. We can fix this by providing a correct number of color references in the palette, or by changing the pattern to only use the one available color (Blue).

3. **BlockOnTarget**: Like the "Wall" and "Target", the "BlockOnTarget" sprite seems to attempt using multiple colors but doesn't have them defined. You either need to define more colors in the palette or modify the pattern to use a single color.

Let's correct the game code by making sure that each object pattern properly corresponds with the colors defined:

- **Wall** has been adjusted so that each pixel in the pattern uses the same color number.
- **Target** and **BlockOnTarget** patterns were made consistent by making sure their pixel assignments correspond with their defined single color.
  
This should resolve the errors related to accessing undefined colors in the sprite patterns.
