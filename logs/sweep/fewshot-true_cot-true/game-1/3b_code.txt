To address the error message, we need to make sure that each object has a sufficiently defined color palette in its sprite design. Each sprite uses colors defined in its palette, and the number of colors provided should match the different colors indexed in the sprite itself.

The error message indicates that the Wall object tries to access color index 1, but only one color was defined, which means there should be at least two distinct colors in the Wall's palette. We can also improve the Collison Layers and Win Conditions to make sure that the game functions as intended.

Here's what we need to do:
1. Correct the color palettes for the Wall object.
2. Update the Collision Layers to include separate layers for BlockOnTarget since it is currently sharing a layer with other objects it should interact distinctly from.
3. Update the Win Conditions to correctly determine when all blocks are on the targets.

Let's fix the code:

In this corrected code:
- The Wall object palette now defines one color, but its sprite is consistent with that—no additional colors needed. This adjustment ensures no access beyond available color indexes.
- The Collision Layers are streamlined to separate Player, Block, and BlockOnTarget, allowing proper interaction between objects.
- The Win Conditions correctly assess that all BlockOnTargets must be on Targets.
