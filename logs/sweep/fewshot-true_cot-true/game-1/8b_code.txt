Certainly! Let's fix the issue in the given PuzzleScript game code. It seems that the problem is likely due to having an inadequate layout where the block cannot be moved onto the target in its initial setup. Here's a modified version of your code that should be solvable:

In this version, the block is placed directly in line with the target, allowing it to be pushed onto the target. The player is also positioned to facilitate easy movement. Try this updated level setup to see if it resolves the solvability issue!
