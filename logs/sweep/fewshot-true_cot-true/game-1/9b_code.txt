I've made a change to the rule `[ > Player | Block ] -> [ > Player | > Block ]` to ensure that a block can only be pushed into an empty space. The new rule is: `[ > Player | Block | no Wall no Block no BlockOnTarget ] -> [ > Player | > Block ]`. Additionally, I adjusted the starting position of the block and player in the first level to ensure its solvability.
