The error messages indicate issues with accessing colors in the sprites for the `Background` and `Wall` objects. It seems that multiple colors are being referenced in these sprites, but only one is defined. Each sprite can have multiple colors, and these need to be defined correctly when the sprite is declared.

To fix the code, we should declare the correct number of colors for the `Background` and `Wall` objects. The current error messages imply that the sprites are attempting to use multiple colors, while only one is declared. Let's set up each object with an appropriate number of colors, even if their design might actually use repeated single colors. Additionally, let's ensure that the Wall's color declaration matches its sprite pattern.

Here's the fixed code:

I've ensured that the objects `Background` and `Wall` are correctly using one color, as their defined sprite pixels only reference one color. No changes were needed for the `Player`, `Block`, `Target`, and `BlockOnTarget` objects, assuming they work correctly. Adjust the color definitions for each sprite as necessary to match the design intent.
