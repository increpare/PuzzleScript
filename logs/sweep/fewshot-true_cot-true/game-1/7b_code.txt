Certainly! It looks like the initial configuration of the level doesn't allow for solving. Here's a revised version of the game that ensures the initial level is solvable:

Changes made:
- Adjusted the level layout so that the player (`P`) can successfully push the block (`*`) onto the target (`O`). The original layout trapped the player between two blocks. This updated level allows for a clear path to solve the puzzle.
