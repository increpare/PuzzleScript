Let's start by identifying the issues highlighted in the console output:

1. **Color Error in Wall Object**: The 'Wall' object is trying to access color numbered beyond the available color palette. The game is trying to access the second index (reference .111.) in a single-color definition (Grey).

2. **Dimension Error in Player Object**: The 'Player' object does not comply with the required 5x5 grid dimensions for sprite graphics which is needed.

We'll fix these issues:
- Update the `Wall` sprite to use a valid color index within its available color palette.
- Adjust the 'Player' sprite's dimensions to fit a 5x5 size.
- Ensure all colors and dimensions are corrected in the specified styles.

Here's the repaired PuzzleScript code:

This revised code adheres to the 5x5 requirement for all sprite graphics and corrects the color palette issue for the 'Wall' object.
