The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code pertain to incorrect use of comments within the rule section. In PuzzleScript, the use of semicolons for comments within the rule setup is not supported. Instead, comments should be placed on a separate line or after a complete section using recognizable delimiters within comments. 

The best plan of action is to remove the incorrect inline comment syntax using semicolons and contain comments in a format that the system doesn't treat as executable code.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

In this corrected version, I have replaced the semicolon `;` with double slashes `//` to designate comments, ensuring that the game code compiles without error.
