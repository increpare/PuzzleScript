To resolve the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Sprites Color Definitions**: Ensure that the `Player`, `Target`, and `Wall` objects have the correct number of colors defined in their color palettes to match how they're being used in their art representations.

2. **Color Palette Issue**: Each object in PuzzleScript can use multiple colors for its pixel art representation. In the error message, we've been told the palette tries to access non-existent colors for `Player`, `Target`, and `Wall`. Thus, more colors need to be defined.

3. **Sprite Representation**:
   - **Player (index 0 and 1 required)**: Let's define `Player` with two colors, and make the sprite fit aesthetically with those colors.
   - **Target (index 2 required)**: Define `Target` with three colors, though here we'll have to select appropriate colors to match the design.
   - **Wall (index 2 required)**: Define `Wall` with at least one more distinct color, ensuring index 1 access is valid.

Let's address these by revising the sprite color palettes and structures:

**Explanation**:
- **Player**: Now has two colors, `DarkBlue` (index 0) and `Blue` (index 1), matching the pixel art usage.
- **Target**: Now includes three colors (`DarkGreen`, `Green`, `LightGreen`), addressing the need for color index 2 in its art.
- **Wall**: Has two colors (`DarkGray`, `Gray`), so it knows what to use if accessing index 1. 

This should resolve the palette errors identified earlier.
