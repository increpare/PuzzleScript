To repair the code, we need to address several key issues as identified in the errors:

1. **Section Ordering and Inclusion**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is meant to follow the `SOUNDS` section according to PuzzleScript requirements. Even if no sounds are used, the section heading for `SOUNDS` must be included. We will add an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. Therefore, names like "Player" and "Wall" must match exactly in both their definitions and usage in rules. The error messages indicate that "player" and "wall" were unrecognized, suggesting a mismatch in capitalization. We need to ensure that the object names in the rules match the definitions.

3. **Extraneous Characters**: There are semicolons in the rules section that PuzzleScript does not recognize. These need to be removed as they are not part of the language syntax.

Taking these steps into account, the corrected code is:

1. Added an empty `SOUNDS` section.
2. Correctly capitalized each instance of `Player` and `Wall` in the `RULES` section to match their definitions.
3. Removed semicolons from the `RULES` section.
