The console output indicates several issues with the original PuzzleScript game code. Let's address these issues step by step:

1. **Section Order**: The "RULES" section must follow the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section. The "COLLISIONLAYERS" section is missing, and it's required to properly define the order of collision layers in the game.

2. **Invalid Object Names**: The error messages indicate that the rules are using lowercase names for "player" and "wall" instead of the correct uppercase versions "Player" and "Wall" as defined in the "LEGEND".

3. **Comments**: PuzzleScript supports comments, but the syntax may have caused confusion. In PuzzleScript, comments are typically prefixed with semicolons (;).

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

Changes made:
- Added the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section and defined the layers in the correct order.
- Changed commented lines in the "RULES" section to use semicolons (;) and corrected object names to use proper uppercase names as defined in the "LEGEND".
- Corrected any missed naming discrepancies to ensure alignment between sections.

This should address the errors and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
