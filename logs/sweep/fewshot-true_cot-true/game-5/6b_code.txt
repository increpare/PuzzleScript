The errors in the console output suggest that the compiler is attempting to interpret the comment as game elements. In PuzzleScript, comments are usually indicated with a `#` at the start of a line, but if they contain additional characters that aren't defined as game elements in the Legend section, it throws errors. To resolve this:

1. Ensure that any comment lines do not contain characters that could be misinterpreted as game elements.
2. Remove or modify problematic comment lines.

Let's fix the code by removing any comments that might be causing issues:

I have removed the comment lines altogether to avoid them being interpreted as game elements. This solves the compilation errors while keeping the structure intact. The comments can be re-added with proper handling or separation, ensuring they don't contain any symbols that might be accidentally interpreted.
