The error messages indicate that the rules are being misinterpreted due to the comments within the script. PuzzleScript does not support inline comments within rule definitions using `//`, which results in the script trying to interpret them incorrectly. To resolve this issue, we must remove the comments placed at the end of the rule lines.

Here's how you can fix it:
- Remove the comments from each rule line, as PuzzleScript does not support inline comments.

Below is the repaired version of the code:

By removing all inline comments within the rule lines, the code should now compile without errors.
