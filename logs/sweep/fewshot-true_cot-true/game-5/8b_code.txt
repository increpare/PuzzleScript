In the given PuzzleScript code, the errors are occurring because the movement rules are not correctly formatted. Specifically, each rule pattern on the left-hand side must have a matching pattern of equal length on the right-hand side. The issue in the existing code is with the movement rules for the player.

Here's the plan to fix it:
- Ensure each movement rule maps the player to itself and considers the target location.
- If the player moves, ensure there is a corresponding shift on the right-hand side to an empty space (background), as recommended for sliding puzzle mechanics.
- Maintain rule symmetry to align the left and right sides of each movement rule.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

In this repaired code:
- The movement rules are adjusted so that the player moves to the target empty background space.
- Symmetric rules ensure that if the player bumps into a wall, they simply stay in place as indicated by `[ Player | Wall]`.
