### Task Reasoning

The console output indicates that there's an issue with the `message` lines. The error message "Key X not found" is referring to a supposed "key" in the context of the `Legend` section, which defines game objects. However, in PuzzleScript, this error more often than not stems from using incorrect object symbols in the level layout or directly placing non-valid characters, such as letters or punctuation that are not defined in the `Legend`.

Examining the provided code, the errors occur due to the use of the `message` command tied directly with the level schema, which may be causing the error due to incorrect usage. The correct way to apply messages in PuzzleScript is by placing the `message` tag after setting up each level layout without placing messages within level schemes directly or in problematic formatting.

### Solution

1. **Messages Formatting**: Ensure that messages are standalone and properly positioned before their relevant level layouts start, without interfering with level grid formatting.
2. **Check for Syntax**: Inspect syntax especially in the rules section to ensure the game logic properly aligns with expected behaviors for items like picking up a key and using it to open a door.

Here's a corrected version of the initial code:

### Changes Made:
- **Formatting**: Shifted `message` lines to be standalone and properly associated with their respective level maps.
- **Rule Correction**: Adjusted rules to ensure logical handling of keys and doors, ensuring that picking a key is registered and usage of the key on a door properly unlocks it.
