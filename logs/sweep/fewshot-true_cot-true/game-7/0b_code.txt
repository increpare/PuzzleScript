To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I will design a simple puzzle game where the player needs to collect keys to open doors. Here's the plan of action:

1. **Define Game Title and Metadata**: Specify the title and author of the game.
  
2. **Define the Game Objects**: We will have objects like Background, Player, Wall, Door, Key, and Exit.

3. **Implement Collisions and Interaction Rules**: Define how the Player can collect keys. A key will allow the player to open and traverse doors.

4. **Define Win Conditions**: The player wins when they reach the Exit.

5. **Create Levels**: Construct a level with a combination of the objects.

By following these steps, a simple yet engaging game can be created. Below is the complete PuzzleScript game code following the plan:
