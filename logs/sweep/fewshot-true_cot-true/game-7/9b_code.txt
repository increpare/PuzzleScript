To address the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript game code provided, we need to fix the misplacement of comments within the rules section. In PuzzleScript, code comments must be formatted with "/* comment */" rather than "#" to avoid errors within the rules section. Additionally, any inadvertent use of comments moving outside these brackets must be avoided. 

Here's a corrected version of the game code:

Adjustments made:
- Corrected comments within the rules section to the proper PuzzleScript comment format, enclosing them within "/* ... */" instead of using "#".
- Ensured all necessary components are properly defined within the rule sets. 

With these changes, the script should compile and run without errors.
