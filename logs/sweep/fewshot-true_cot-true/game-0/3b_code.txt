To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the errors flagged in the console output. Here's the plan of action to fix the errors:

1. **Color Specification Errors**: Ensure that colors are defined correctly for all objects. In the console output, it specifies `Gold` for `Target`, which needs to be present in a valid format [e.g., two or three colors]. Let's modify it to something like `Yellow` or with pattern as `Yellow White DarkYellow`.

2. **Rectangular Map Error**: Ensure all rows in the level map have the same length. Adjust and verify the map layout so all rows have equal characters/tiles.

3. **Rule Specification Errors**: 
   - The rule `[> Player | Switch] -> [> Player | Switch] [Laser -> LaserOn]` contains an incorrect format. The rule should ensure corresponding sections on either side of the arrow `->`. Instead, activate the laser in the context of Player on Switch.
   - Errors triggered by `[ Beam | Target] -> [ Beam | Target] Win`. Correctly implement `Win` after a condition is achieved; remove one set of brackets.

After reasoning through these, here's the corrected version of the game code:
