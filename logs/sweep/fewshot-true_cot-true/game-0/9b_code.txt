To address the errors, we need to ensure that each pattern on the left side of the rule corresponds to a pattern of equal length on the right side. After reviewing the game code, it seems that some rules are not correctly structured because they may be missing a corresponding right-side pattern. Specifically:

- The rule `[Beam | Wall] -> []` must have a corresponding right pattern.
- The rule `[Beam | Target] -> [ Beam | Target]` looks fine since it has a matching structure.

Let's correct these and introduce a suitable solution to the identified problems:

1. Modify the `[Beam | Wall] -> []` rule to remove the beam block when it encounters a wall. We'll adjust it to `[Beam | Wall] -> [ | Wall]`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

These changes ensure each rule has both left and right patterns of equal length, thus resolving the console error.
