To fix the errors present in the PuzzleScript code, let's address each issue step-by-step:

1. **Player and Mirror Palette Index Errors**: The Player and Mirror objects each attempt to access color indices that are out of bounds. Ensure each object has a defined color palette that matches the required indices.

2. **Gold Color Error**: The `Target` object's color palette uses a color "Gold" which isn't recognized. We need to specify RGB values for custom colors.

3. **Palette Index Errors for Target and LaserOn**: Ensure the color indices for the Target and LaserOn objects match the intended palette size.

Let's correct these issues:

- For each object, verify and correct its color palette size and access according to its design.
- Replace "Gold" with appropriate RGB values.
- Ensure proper color access within each object's defined palette.

Here’s the repaired version of the game code:

**Modifications:**
- Fixed color index errors by providing enough colors and using valid indices in the Player and Mirror objects.
- Replaced "Gold" in the `Target` object with an equivalent RGB value (#FFD700) to properly define the color.
- Added valid access to the colors defined in Target and LaserOn.
