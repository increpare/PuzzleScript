To repair the PuzzleScript code, we need to address the problems highlighted by the errors found in the initial attempt:

1. **Comma Error**: In PuzzleScript, using commas in rules is invalid unless they're within the context of actions or directions. The rule using the comma needs to be rewritten without using a comma.

2. **Map Rectangular Error**: The levels must be rectangular, meaning each row within a level must have the same number of characters.

3. **Malformed Rule Due to Misplaced Arrow**: The rule for toggling the laser was incorrectly specified because the arrow `->` should separate states not inside the same square brackets, and any actions or directions should be handled properly.

4. **Unequal Pattern Matches**: Each pattern on the left should have a corresponding pattern on the right side of `->` in a rule.

Let's address these by:

- Correcting the rule to toggle the laser state.
- Ensuring each level row is the same length.
- Ensuring actions like switching the laser status are done correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

In this revised version, the key changes are:

- The toggle of the `Laser` to `LaserOn` should be managed carefully.
- The level layout has been fixed to remedy the rectangular error.
- The handling of beams and lasers ensures movement without malformed rules. 

Please adapt the toggle logic carefully based on how the game should behave with respect to activating lasers. Additional logic may be needed if laser toggling requires specific conditions.
