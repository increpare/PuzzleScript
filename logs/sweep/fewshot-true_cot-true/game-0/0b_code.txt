Let's create a simple PuzzleScript game that introduces a new concept. We'll design a game in which the player has to push mirrors to reflect a laser beam onto a target. The game will involve basic mechanics like moving the player, pushing mirrors, and reflecting a beam. 

**Game Outline:**
- The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- Mirrors can be pushed and will reflect the laser beam.
- The laser beam can be turned on or off by a switch.
- The objective is to direct the laser beam to hit the target.

**Objects:**
- Player: Movable character controlled by the player.
- Mirror: Reflects the laser beam.
- Laser: Initially off, can be turned on by switching.
- Target: Needs to be hit by the laser to win the game.
- Switch: Toggles the laser on and off.
- Wall: Impedes movement.

**Win Condition:**
- The laser beam must hit the target.

Here's the complete code for our game:
