To address the compilation error mentioned in the console output, we need to examine the rule patterns in the code to ensure that each pattern on the left side of a rule has a corresponding pattern on the right side of equal length. In PuzzleScript, rules are defined with left-side patterns being transformed into right-side patterns, and each pattern must be of the same size.

The specific line causing the error is likely due to mismatched pattern lengths within the rules. Let's analyze the relevant rules:

- `[> Player | Switch] -> [> Player | LaserOn]`: This rule is correct.
- `[right Player | Mirror]`: It seems the rules handling Player moves with Mirrors were meant to allow freely moving to a location with a mirror, but they have mismatched lengths since the right pattern was not given, suggesting possible intent confusion.
- `[L | Mirror] -> [B | Mirror]`: This rule is correct since it has equal patterns on both sides.

For the rules about moving:
- Make sure the movement aspect doesn't get hindered and Player is not supposed just to be adjacent to the mirror, you probably want no transformation upon reaching Mirror which based on lack of respective rules seems intended. 

To solve this issue and keep the intended gameplay, we'll modify the rules where there are pattern mismatch errors. By inspecting closely, one solution would be the removal of those particular rules with mismatches, assuming they were simply fillers or in continuation of player movement meant to handle interactions subtly with Mirrors without stopping them. Any custom behavior when interacting with Mirrors should have been specified but rules indicate absence of those interactions.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

In the process of this modification, I've removed unmatched rules for Player and Mirror interactions that potentially aren't useful given your intended gameplay. If such behavior was intended, you'd need to redefine how the Player interacts with Mirrors carefully, ensuring each interaction fits your actual goals for puzzle mechanics without causing errors.
