To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we will take the following steps:

1. **Correct the Color Specification for the `Target` Object**: 
   - The error message indicates there is an issue with the color specification for `Target`. We'll correct this by ensuring we use the correct color format.
   
2. **Fix Level Rectangle Error**: 
   - Ensure that all rows in the level definition are of the same length to make it rectangular.

3. **Fix Rule Syntax Errors**: 
   - Review and correct rule syntax, particularly the usage of the arrow (`->`) and patterns on both sides of it.

4. **Correct Number of Patterns Error in Rules**:
   - Each pattern on the left side of the `->` should have a corresponding pattern on the right side.

Let's review and fix the mentioned issues:

Summary of Changes:
- Replaced `FFD700 FFD700` with `Gold` which is a predefined color, solving the color specification error.
- Ensured that the level definition is rectangular by adjusting the row lengths.
- Corrected the syntax errors and ensured that the rules are specified with the correct number of pattern elements on both sides of `->`.
