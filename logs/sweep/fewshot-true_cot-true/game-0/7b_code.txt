The errors in the given PuzzleScript game code involve two key issues:

1. **Rectangular Map Error**: Each level in a PuzzleScript game must be rectangular, which means that every row must have the same number of columns. The provided level violates this rule because the rows have different lengths.

2. **Pattern Matching Error**: The rules in PuzzleScript require that patterns on the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) are of equal length, meaning the same number of cells across. One of the rules in the code does not adhere to this requirement.

To address these issues:

1. **Make the Level Rectangular**: Review the level to ensure every row has the same number of columns. In this case, adjust rows to have a consistent width. 

2. **Ensure Patterns Match**: In rules, ensure that for each pattern on the LHS of a rule, there is a corresponding pattern of the same length on the RHS. Specifically, the rule `[ L | Mirror] -> [B | Mirror]` and `[ Beam no Mirror | Wall] -> []` are suspect and need to be adjusted to keep consistent pattern lengths.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

**Notes on Changes:**

- Ensured all rows in the level are 7 characters long by adding a period at the end of the last row: `######.`.
- Modified rules to ensure each rule has equal-length patterns on both sides (mirroring). In particular, ensured `[ L | Mirror]` has corresponding `[ B | Mirror]`, including spaces when necessary, and `[Beam | Wall] -> []` rule is replaced with `[Beam | Wall] -> [  | Wall]` to maintain equal lengths.

These changes should address the compilation errors and allow the game to run correctly.
