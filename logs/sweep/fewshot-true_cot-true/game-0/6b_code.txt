To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the compilation errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Error with the `when` keyword**: PuzzleScript doesn't support conditional rules with `when`. We will need to revise the game logic to control lasers using a different method. Typically, the state change (e.g., turning a laser on or off) is controlled using objects that represent states and changing them using specific conditions.

2. **Rectangular map requirement**: Each level's rows must have the same length for the grid to be rectangular. The error indicates that the level is not rectangular, so we'll make sure all rows have equal lengths.

3. **Malformed rules and mapping**: Ensure rules are correctly formatted with balanced patterns on both sides of the '->'. Furthermore, we'll check that objects on the map conform to those in the objects section.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Changes Made:
- Removed the use of the non-existent `when` keyword. We directly switch the laser to 'LaserOn' using `[> Player | Switch] -> [> Player | LaserOn]`.
- Ensured the level definition is rectangular by adjusting the length of each row to be equal.
- Revised the `COLLISIONLAYERS` and `RULES` to ensure consistent logic flow based on available PuzzleScript features and syntax.
