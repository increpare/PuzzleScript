Let's break down the errors provided by the console output and determine how to address them:

1. **Error on line 95**: 
   - The error message indicates that there is an unexpected "," (comma) that does not exist as a defined object.
   - After reviewing the line, the issue seems to be a misuse of the comma in the rule definition: `[> Player | Switch] -> [> Player | Switch], [Laser -> LaserOn]`. The comma is incorrectly used here. Instead, a rule should have one match pattern on the left side and one on the right side of the arrow. Since the intention is likely to change the state of the `Laser` to `LaserOn` when a player steps on the switch, we should define this correctly.

2. **Level Map Errors**:
   - The map entries are of different lengths, leading to the rectangular requirement not being met.
   - We'll make the level map properly rectangular by adding a missing symbol where necessary.

3. **Fix Rules**:
   - We'll correct the rule that toggles the laser to its active state when the player interacts with the switch.
   - We'll also adjust the rule regarding the beams' interaction with mirrors and respect the conventions.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

### Explanation:
- **Rule Fix**: The `Laser` to `LaserOn` transformation upon stepping on a `Switch` should be separated by conditions instead of using commas: `[Laser] -> [LaserOn] when [Switch]`.
- **Map Rectification**: The level is fixed to ensure equal row lengths, assumed `. (Background)` to equalize lengths where required. 
- The corrections ensure syntax is right as per PuzzleScript rules, enabling successful compilation and game execution.
