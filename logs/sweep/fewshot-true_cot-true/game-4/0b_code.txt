Before I provide the complete PuzzleScript game code, let's outline the plan of action. 

1. **Conceptualize the Game**: Decide on a theme and basic mechanics. Let's make a simple sushi collecting game where the player is a cat that needs to eat all the sushi to win.

2. **Define the Objects**: We'll need a player (cat), collectible items (sushi), and obstacles (such as walls).

3. **Create Collision Layers**: Define which objects can interact or overlap with others.

4. **Write Game Rules**: Establish how the player can move, how they interact with sushi, and what happens when a sushi is eaten.

5. **Set Win Conditions**: Define the condition to win the game, like collecting all sushi.

6. **Create Levels**: Design levels where the player can navigate and collect sushi.

7. **Testing and Balancing**: Ensure all elements interact as expected and create a balanced difficulty.

Now, let's write the actual game code.

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined a `Cat` as the player, `Sushi` as collectible items, and `Wall` as impassable obstacles.
- **Collision Layers**: Set the cat to be blocked by walls and able to collect sushi.
- **Rules**: When the cat moves (`Player`) into a tile with sushi, the sushi is removed, simulating collection.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when there are no sushi pieces left on the board.
- **Levels**: Two levels are created, with different placements of walls and sushi to navigate and collect.
- **Ending Message**: Displays a congratulatory message upon collecting all sushi.

This code creates a simple yet fun game where players must navigate levels to collect all sushi pieces with the cat. Adjust and add additional levels for continued gameplay and increased difficulty.
