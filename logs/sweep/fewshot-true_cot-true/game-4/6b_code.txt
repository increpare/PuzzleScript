To fix these errors, let's address each one step by step:

1. **Player Definition Error**: The error mentions that `PLAYER` is not defined. In PuzzleScript, the player should be defined in the OBJECTS section. In the LEGEND section, we need to use a lowercase `p` for the player since using an uppercase description like `P` can sometimes confuse the script with a legend alias (depending on prior setup and conventions). Make sure the `Cat` represents the player object. 

2. **Symbol Not Found Error**: We need to ensure the lowercase `p` is used consistently for the player. The map uses uppercase `P`, but we should change it to match the `Cat` object legend.

3. **Collision Layers Assignment**: Ensure the player (Cat) is listed directly in the COLLISIONLAYERS, instead of being indirectly aliased through `P`.

Let's address these by updating the code accordingly:

**Key Changes:**
- Defined the `Cat` as the player object by aliasing it as `p` in the LEGEND section.
- Updated the map levels to use `p` for the Cat. 
- Ensured `Cat` is directly listed in COLLISIONLAYERS, as it represents the player element in the game.

This should resolve the errors you encountered, and now the code should compile and function correctly.
