To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Fix Section Order**: The error mentions that the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section is out of order and should follow a "SOUNDS" section, even if it's empty. We'll add an empty "SOUNDS" section before "COLLISIONLAYERS".

2. **Declare Player Object**: The code refers to a "Player" in the collision layer but hasn't declared one. We'll set the Cat as the player.

3. **Correct Legend and Rules Cases**: The code refers to "player" and "sushi" in rules and win conditions. In PuzzleScript, object names are case-sensitive and should match the declared object names exactly. We'll update these references to "Cat" and "Sushi" according to their declared names.

4. **Win Condition Syntax**: Ensure win condition references match the object names as declared.

Here's the revised game code:

Adjustments:
- Added an empty "SOUNDS" section.
- Updated collision layer "Player" to "Cat".
- Adjusted rules to use "Cat" and "Sushi" (capitalized as declared).
- Revised the win condition to correctly reference "No Sushi".
