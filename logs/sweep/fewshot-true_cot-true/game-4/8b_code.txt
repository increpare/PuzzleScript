To repair the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Symbol Definition**:
   - The console output indicates that the symbol `P` is not defined in the legend, which corresponds to the `p` used in the level maps to reference the player or the Cat. We need to ensure that the player is correctly defined.

2. **Legend Correction**:
    - The legend currently defines the Player as `Cat`. We should ensure that the legend assigns `P` to the `Cat` object.

3. **Level Map Correction**:
    - The level maps reference `p`, which is not defined. It should use `P` instead, matching the key defined in the legend for the player.

Let's correct these issues:

1. Update the legend to correctly associate the symbol `P` with the `Cat` object.
2. Correct the level map to use `P` instead of `p`.

Here's the corrected code:

The updated code defines `P` as `Cat` in the legend, which resolves the errors related to undefined symbols. The level map now correctly uses `P` for the initial position of the Player. This should ensure that the game compiles and runs without errors.
