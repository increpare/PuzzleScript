In the current PuzzleScript game, the problem lies in the LEGEND section where there is an attempt to define `p` as `Cat`, which is supposed to be used as the player object. The error message indicates that the game logic unable to identify the `Player` object.

Additionally, removing sushi isn't currently achieved in the provided ruleset. To fix the problem, we need to ensure that our game has an object identified as the player, correctly defined in the `LEGEND` section as well, and also add a rule to remove the `Sushi` when collected by the player.

Here is the repair plan:
1. Change the player definition from `p` to the reserved `Player` keyword in the `LEGEND` section such that `Player = Cat`.
2. Ensure rules that allow the player (Cat) to collect the `Sushi` correctly adjusts the object map in each step.

Here is the corrected code with these adjustments:

Now, the player object is correctly represented as `Player`, and interacting with `Sushi` will remove the `Sushi` from the game field, allowing the game to function properly and the win condition to be achievable.
