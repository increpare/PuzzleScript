The errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code indicate that there are attempts to access color indices in the sprite definitions that go beyond what has been defined. Specifically, the color palette for the `Wall` object is not correctly defined to support the access attempts, and similarly for the `Cat` object, where an index is attempted that does not exist.

Here’s the plan of action to fix the errors:

1. **Analyze and fix the `Wall` sprite color issue:**
   - The sprite matrix (`11111`) requires two colors (since '1' requires a secondary color). The current setup of `DarkGrey` only defines one color. I will add another color to the definition. Using a more specific contrast, e.g., `LightGrey`, will make it consistent with the apparent design.

2. **Analyze and fix the `Cat` sprite:**
   - The `Cat` sprite definition is attempting to use index `3`, meaning it needs at least four colors. I will add additional colors as appropriate.

After these adjustments, I will re-check the game's logic to ensure it remains consistent, then write down the altered code.

Here's the corrected game code:

### Explanation:
- **Wall**: Added `LightGrey` to the palette so each '1' can be depicted.
- **Cat**: Provided a palette with four color entries based on the likely design intention, e.g., using Black and White for details.
  
This code fixes the initial color palette errors and should compile without issues, keeping your game's intended functionality intact.
