To make this game solvable, we need to adjust the levels so that the player can push the TreasureChests onto the Targets. Here is the revised PuzzleScript code with solvable levels:

```plaintext

Background

Wall
darkgray

TreasureChest

# = Wall
P = Player
* = TreasureChest
@ = TreasureChest and Target
O = Target

```

The changes made include ensuring that there is a clear path for the player to push the TreasureChest onto the Target in each level. Adjustments are needed to walls and object positions to facilitate this. Play-testing these levels can help ensure they are indeed solvable.
