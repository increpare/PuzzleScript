The error in the code is due to the misplacement of the `Move` sound definition in the `SOUNDS` section. The correct term to use is `movement`. In PuzzleScript, sound types must match predefined keywords, such as `movement`, `win`, `undo`, etc. 

To fix this, replace `Move` with `movement` in the `SOUNDS` section. Here is the corrected code:

I've corrected the `SOUNDS` section so that the keyword `movement` is used instead of `Move`. This should resolve the syntax error related to the sound token and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
