To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Add a `SOUNDS` Section**: Add an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS` to adhere to the required structure.
2. **Correct Object Names**: Ensure that the object names are consistent between the `OBJECTS` section and how they are referenced in the `RULES` and `WINCONDITIONS` sections. Specifically, capitalize the names used consistently throughout the code.
3. **Correct Win Condition Syntax**: Use the correct object names in the `WINCONDITIONS` section. Correct the capitalization to match the `LEGEND` definitions.
4. **Fix Rule Syntax**: Ensure rules use the correct names as defined in the `LEGEND`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

Key adjustments made:
- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
- Ensured consistent capitalization of `Player`, `TreasureChest`, and `Target` as used in `LEGEND` and referenced in rules and win conditions.
- Used `All Target on TreasureChest` in the win conditions for clarity and accuracy.
