Certainly! To make your game levels solvable, you need to ensure that there's a potential path for the Player to push all TreasureChests onto their respective Targets. I've made adjustments to your levels to ensure solvability while maintaining the original concepts.

Here's the revised code:

```plaintext

Background

TreasureChest

. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
* = TreasureChest
@ = TreasureChest and Target
O = Target

These revised levels ensure that the player has a path to push the TreasureChests onto the Targets without getting stuck or blocked by walls. Each level now presents a solvable puzzle.
