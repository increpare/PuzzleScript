The error message indicates that there is an issue with the use of the character " " (a space) in the level maps. In PuzzleScript, the character " " is not automatically mapped to the Background object unless explicitly specified. An easy fix is to ensure the space in the level maps is correctly interpreted as the Background. 

To resolve this, I will introduce a mapping for the space character in the LEGEND section as Background:

```plaintext
title Treasure Cave Explorer
author YourName
homepage www.example.com

========
OBJECTS
========

Background
lightgray

Wall
darkgray

Player
lightgreen

TreasureChest
#FFD700

Target

. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
* = TreasureChest
@ = TreasureChest and Target
O = Target
  = Background  # Added rule to handle spaces

By adding the space character as a representation of the Background, the error should be resolved. Now, the space in the level's map will be correctly interpreted as representing the Background object.
