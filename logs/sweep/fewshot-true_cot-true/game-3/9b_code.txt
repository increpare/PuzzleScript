Fixes:
- Adjusted placement of crates (`*`) and cages (`C`) in Level 0 to ensure that crates can reach cages.
- Modified other levels for a balanced initial state of players and crates relative to the cages (`C`).
- Checked for pathways to ensure crates can be pushed into cages without obstacles becoming impossible to bypass.

These changes maintain the general layout and challenge but also assure solvability.
