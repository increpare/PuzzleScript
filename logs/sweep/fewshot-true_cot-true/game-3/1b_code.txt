To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to focus on two main errors as identified in the console output:

1. **Unexpected Sound Token**: The error indicates that `RescueCat CREATE 12345678` is not a valid sound token. This is because there is likely a typo or misunderstanding in the naming of the sound events. Based on standard PuzzleScript sound naming conventions, the correct sound token when a `RescueCat` is created should reflect the creation of the entity rather than explicitly mentioning "CREATE". Therefore, we can rectify this by omitting or properly naming the corresponding sound event.

2. **Non-Rectangular Level**: This error means one or more of the levels are not shaped as perfect rectangles; each row in a level must have the same number of characters. Upon inspecting the level data, the second level is non-rectangular. We need to ensure all level rows have the same length by padding with `.` (Background).

Here is the corrected code with the discussed changes:

**Changes Made:**

- Fixed the `CREATE` sound token by removing it from the `RescueCat` sound line, assuming it was intended to be triggered during creation.
- In the level section, the second level was initially non-rectangular, with its last row having only six characters. By removing one character from the row or ensuring uniformity, we corrected this imbalance while padding with necessary Background or Wall characters to align the dimensions.
