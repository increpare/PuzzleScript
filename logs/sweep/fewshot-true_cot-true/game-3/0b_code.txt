To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll first define a simple concept that will guide the game's design. Let's create a game based on the theme of "Rescue the Cats," where the player must navigate a maze to save cats trapped in cages. The player must push crates to clear paths and reach the cages.

Here's the plan:

1. **Title and Author**: Define the title and author details.
2. **Objects**:
   - **Background**: Standard background for the game.
   - **Wall**: To form the maze boundaries.
   - **Player**: The character controlled by the player.
   - **Crate**: Moveable blocks that can be pushed to access new areas.
   - **Cage**: Represents the trapped cats.
   - **RescuedCat**: Cats that have been rescued.
3. **Legend**: Define symbols for various objects in the game.
4. **Sounds**: Define sounds for player movement and rescue actions.
5. **CollisionLayers**: Define layers to handle object interactions.
6. **Rules**:
   - Allow the player to push crates.
   - Transform a cage into a rescued cat when the player reaches it.
7. **WinConditions**: The player wins when all cats are rescued.
8. **Levels**: Create a few levels illustrating increasing difficulty.

Now, I'll write the code implementing this plan.
