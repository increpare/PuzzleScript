Certainly! Below is the updated code with a focus on ensuring each level is solvable. The main issue in the original design might have been incorrectly placed crates or cages, or inaccessible paths for the player to push crates onto the cages. I've made adjustments to ensure that each level is solvable:

In the adjusted levels:

1. Level 0: Ensures that the single crate can be moved to the cage.
2. Level 1: Adjust the positions such that the player has clear paths to push crates onto cages.
3. Level 2: Provides multiple crates with straightforward pathways to the cages.

These changes should make each level solvable while maintaining the core idea of pushing crates onto cages to reveal rescued cats.
