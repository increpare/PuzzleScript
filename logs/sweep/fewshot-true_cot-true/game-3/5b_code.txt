It seems the issue with the game might be that the win condition specifies all `RescuedCat` must be on `Cage`, but there's no rule to turn a `Crate` into a `RescuedCat` when pushed onto a `Cage`. Let's fix this by adding a rule to transform `Crate` into `RescuedCat` upon contacting a `Cage`. Here's the corrected code:

With this change, the game should now be solvable because the `Crate` is transformed into `RescuedCat` when pushed onto a `Cage`, thus meeting the win condition: "All `RescuedCat` on `Cage`."
