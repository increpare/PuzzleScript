To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the errors mentioned in the console output.

1. **Sound Verb Misuse**: The error at line 68 indicates an issue with a sound definition. The `RescuedCat 12345678` declaration is incorrect because it's not using a proper sound verb. Let's remove or correct this, as `RescuedCat` isn't an action typically associated with movement or destruction that would need a sound.

2. **Map Rectangularity**: The errors at lines 105 and 106 indicate that the level maps are not rectangular. Each row in a level must have the same number of characters. We'll correct this by ensuring all rows in each level have the same length by adding the necessary number of background tiles `.`.

Here is the repaired version of the code:

### Key Corrections:
- Removed the incorrect `RescuedCat 12345678` sound declaration.
- Added background tiles `.` to make each row in the levels rectangular, ensuring that each row in a level has the same length. The final design reflects the original structure while maintaining valid formatting.
