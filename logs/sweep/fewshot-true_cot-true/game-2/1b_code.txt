To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's address each error one by one.

1. **Unexpected sound token "collect"**: The `SOUNDS` section lists available sound effects, but there seems to be a syntax issue with how the `collect` sound is defined. We need to ensure that the sound definition is correctly formatted in the `SOUNDS` section.

2. **Sprite graphics size**: The error message indicates that the graphics for `Player` and `Star` are not sized correctly. The graphics for each object must be 5x5 pixels. We will correct the dimensions of `Player` and `Star`.

3. **Malformed cell rule with "collect"**: The `collect` token in the rules is misplaced. Instead of being separate, it should be used as part of a trigger action for the rule.

Given these errors, here is how we can fix the code:

- Ensure that the `collect` sound is correctly defined in the `SOUNDS` section and used appropriately in the rules.
- Fix the dimension errors by ensuring all sprite graphics are 5x5.
- Correct the usage of the `collect` sound in the rules.

Changes made:

- Corrected the sprite graphic dimensions for `Background`, `Player`, `Star`, and `Wall` to ensure they are all 5x5.
- Ensured the `collect` sound is properly defined in the `SOUNDS` section.
- Used `collect` sound correctly as an inline effect in the rule when the player picks up a star.

These changes should resolve the console output errors and ensure the game compiles correctly.
