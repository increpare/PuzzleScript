The console output indicates that there's an issue with the "collect" sound token usage. Specifically, the problem arises because the "collect" sound is defined in the "SOUNDS" section without being associated with any rule directly. In PuzzleScript, you should refer to the sound effect immediately within the section of the rules by using the sound identifier as part of the rule it pertains to.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

```

Here's what was changed:

1. **Sound Reference Update**: In the RULES section, the line `[ > Player | Star ] -> [ > Player | ] collect` has been changed to `[ > Player | Star ] -> [ > Player | ] SFX1`. This correctly refers to the "collect" sound which was defined earlier in the SOUNDS section as "SFX1".

I hope this fixed version resolves the issue. Feel free to test it out!
