To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address three main points identified in the error messages:

1. **Section Order**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is not in its correct order. To fix this, we need to add a `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. Even if there are no sounds being used, the heading must be present.

2. **Name Recognition**: The game references object names like `Player`, `Crate`, and `Target` in the rules, but these need to be defined in the `LEGEND` section using lowercase references in the rules. This means we need to adjust the references in the `RULES` section to match the defined object names in the `LEGEND`.

3. **Correct Object References in Rules**: Ensure that references used in the rules are consistent with those declared in the `LEGEND`.

Here is the corrected version of the game code with these issues addressed:

With these corrections, the game code adheres to the expected section order and proper naming conventions for objects within rules and the legend.
