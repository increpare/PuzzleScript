To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, the key lies in understanding the problem pointed out in the console output: the `Crate` and `Target` are on the same collision layer, which makes them unable to coexist, hence causing the rules and win conditions to fail.

Here's a plan to fix the issues:
1. Move `Target` to a separate collision layer from `Crate`, allowing overlap and creation of the `@` aggregate in the `LEGEND` section.
2. Adjust collision layers accordingly.
3. Ensure rules and win conditions correctly reference `@`.

Let's proceed to write the corrected code:

```

In the adjusted script:
- `Target` has been placed on its own collision layer, allowing `Crate` and `Target` to be stacked to create the `@` aggregate.
- Updated rules process this new state interaction correctly, maintaining game logic.
