This PuzzleScript error occurred because of an unexpected sound token "collect" in the SOUNDS section. It appears that the sound entry, "collect," is not being used properly in the RULES section. To fix this, we'll need to ensure that the sound token used in the RULES corresponds to the name of the sound defined in the SOUNDS section. Here's the plan:

1. In the SOUNDS section, rename "collect" to a more generic name like "SFX1" to match its use in the RULES section.
2. Ensure that all sound effects in the rules reference the defined sound names correctly.

Here’s the corrected version of the code:

By changing "collect" to "SFX1" in the SOUNDS section, the code now properly matches the sound reference used in the RULES where it mentions "SFX1". This ensures that the correct sound effect plays when a player collects a star.
