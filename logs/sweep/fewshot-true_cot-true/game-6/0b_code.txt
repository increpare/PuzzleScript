To create a complete PuzzleScript game, it's essential to establish a theme or a core mechanic around which the game will revolve. Let's go with a classic concept: a simple puzzle game where the player must move boxes to designated goals. This is similar to the classic "Sokoban" game, which is a good starting point for puzzle mechanics as it combines straightforward rules with engaging, brain-teasing gameplay.

Here's a step-by-step plan of action:

1. **Define the Title and Author:** Provide basic information about the game.
2. **Design Color Scheme:** Set visually pleasing color preferences for text and background.
3. **Set Basic Game Properties:** Include any required settings such as screen dimensions and intervals.
4. **Define Game Objects:** Create visual representations for all game elements such as walls, boxes, player, and goals using simple pixel art.
5. **Establish Collision Layers:** Define which objects can occupy the same spaces and which cannot.
6. **Implement Game Rules:** Describe how different elements interact, such as how a player pushes boxes.
7. **Specify Win Conditions:** Define what needs to occur for the level to be completed successfully.
8. **Create Levels:** Design levels that test the player's ability to solve the puzzle using the established mechanics.

Below is the complete code for a PuzzleScript game titled "Box Push Puzzle":

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** We defined basic objects like the player, wall, box, goal, and an additional state for a box on a goal.
- **Collision Layers:** Separate layers ensure that players don't move through boxes and walls but interact with them.
- **Rules:** The player can push boxes into empty spaces or onto goals. Boxes on goals change state to show progress.
- **Win Conditions:** All boxes must be positioned onto goals for the level to be won.
- **Levels:** Create a couple of starter levels to introduce gameplay mechanics.

This code will allow you to test and play through simple Sokoban-style puzzles within the constraints of PuzzleScript. Feel free to expand on it with more complex mechanics, larger levels, and additional features as needed.
