To address the compilation errors shown in the console output, let's break down the issues:

1. **Unexpected sound token "push":** In PuzzleScript, sounds are specified with a command followed by a unique identifier (usually an integer). The current "push 1000" format is incorrect; it should be something like "sfx0".

2. **Error, symbol `" "` (blank space) used in map, not found:** The error indicates that there's a symbol used in the level map that's not defined in the legend section. Since a blank space is used to represent the background, it should be explicitly defined in the legend section as "=" or you can replace the spaces with dots (.) which are defined as Background.

3. **Rule pattern length mismatch:** This error implies that the number of cells in pattern elements on the left side of a rule does not match the right side. 

Let's fix these issues in the PuzzleScript code:

- Replace the "push 1000" with "sfx0" to correctly link sound effects.
- Ensure every symbol used in level maps is defined in the legend section. Since the period "." represents Background, let's use it for empty spaces in the levels.
- Correct the rule so that the transformation from `BoxOnGoal` to `Box` keeps the same number of elements in the pattern on both sides.

Here is the repaired code:

- Changed " " to "." in level definitions to match the legend for Background.
- Adjusted sound definition to "sfx0 1000".
- Also, reviewed rules for consistent patterns on both sides.
