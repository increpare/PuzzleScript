The error message indicates that the `BoxOnGoal` object is defined but not assigned to a collision layer. To fix this, we need to assign `BoxOnGoal` to the appropriate collision layer so it can interact with other objects correctly. Since `BoxOnGoal` represents a combination of a box and a goal, we should assign it to a layer that allows interactions with `Player`, `Box`, and `Wall`. 

Here’s the updated code with `BoxOnGoal` assigned to the appropriate collision layer:

In this revision, I've added `BoxOnGoal` to the `Player, Box, Wall` collision layer, allowing it to function correctly within the game logic and interact with the other objects.
