The code contains errors related to sprite definitions and lengths. The error messages indicate that the sprites for "Wall," "Player," "Goal," and "Box" do not have appropriate dimensions or color definitions. In PuzzleScript, sprites should be 5x5 grids. Let's address these issues in the modified code.

Plan of Action:
1. Correct the size of the Wall, Player, Goal, and Box sprites to be 5x5.
2. Adjust color usage to ensure that there are sufficient colors defined for each object.
3. Use consistent sprite coloring and sizing.

Here's the revised code:

```
Changes made:
- Adjusted each object's sprite definition to ensure they are all 5x5 grids.
- Corrected color usage in the Wall sprite. The corrected Wall sprite uses '.' for unused pixels.
These changes should resolve the compile-time errors and allow the game to run correctly.
