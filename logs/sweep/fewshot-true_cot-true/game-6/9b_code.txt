To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address a few issues highlighted by the compilation errors:

1. **Wall Sprite Color Error**: The console output indicates that there's an attempt to access color number 1 in the "Wall" sprite, but only 1 color is defined. We need to update the Wall sprite to correctly use two colors - one for the wall and one for the missing part.

2. **Sprite Dimension Errors**: The console states that the "Goal" and "Box" sprites must be 5x5, but they currently are not, causing errors. We'll adjust these sprites to meet the required dimensions.

We'll fix these issues as follows:

- For the `Wall` object, I'll define a second color that will be used as the background or empty space, as per the 5x5 constraint for all sprites.
- Ensure that all sprites, especially `Goal` and `Box`, are 5x5 in size.

Here is the corrected code:

Changes made:
- Added a second color `white` to the `Wall` sprite to meet the required two-color definition.
- Adjusted the `Goal` and `Box` sprites to be 5x5, adding `.....` lines to make up the shortfall while maintaining their visible design.
