To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure the correct order of sections and refer to object names with the correct cases, as PuzzleScript is case-sensitive.

Here's a repaired version of the code:

```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Section Order**: 
   - Added an empty `SOUNDS` section to ensure the mandated order is followed. In PuzzleScript, the order of sections is critical to avoid compilation errors.

2. **Case Sensitivity in Rules**: 
    - Corrected object names in the `RULES` section to match the cases used in the `OBJECTS` section. For example, ensuring "Player", "Crate", and "Background" are capitalized.

These changes should fix the reported errors in the game code compilation.
