Creating a complete PuzzleScript game involves defining the rules, objects, levels, player win states, and other components. Below is an example implementation of a simple Sokoban-like game in PuzzleScript. This game features a player that needs to push crates onto target spots.

### Explanation

- **Objects**: Define the game's visual elements (Player, Crate, Target, etc.). Each object has a unique name and color.
  
- **Legend**: Maps characters to objects. These characters are used to define levels.
  
- **Sounds**: Optional elements to add sound effects when specified rules are triggered (e.g., moving crates, winning a level).
  
- **CollisionLayers**: Specify which objects can overlap or collide. This prevents, for instance, the player from walking through walls.

- **Rules**: Define how objects behave when interacted with. The rules tell the game engine what should happen in response to player moves. In this case, rules for moving crates and turning them into `CrateOnTarget` when placed on targets are defined.

- **WinConditions**: Specify the condition for completing a level. Here, all `CrateOnTarget` must be present to win.

- **Levels**: Define the layout of the game levels, using the characters specified in the Legend.

This setup should give you a basic working PuzzleScript game. You can test it within the PuzzleScript editor to see it in action.
