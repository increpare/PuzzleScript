It seems that there are several errors in your PuzzleScript game code. Here's a corrected version of your code addressing these issues:

- The `SOUNDS` section is not recognized by PuzzleScript, so it has to be removed.
- The rule for moving crates was malformed and must be corrected.
- Levels need to be rectangular; uneven rows in levels should be fixed.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

- Removed the `SOUNDS` section since it is not part of the PuzzleScript language.
- Corrected the rule that was using an unrecognized action (pull1).
- Made sure that each level in `LEVELS` is a rectangular grid by adding enough '.' characters to balance row lengths where necessary.
