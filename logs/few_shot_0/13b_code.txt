To address the issues in the code, we need to correct the level map format so that each level is rectangular, and also handle the spaces (" ") that were used but not defined. Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation of the changes:

1. **Rectangular Levels:** Both levels are adjusted to be rectangular. Each row within a level is of equal length (6 columns in this case).

2. **Spaces Handling:** Symbols for empty spaces (" ") are replaced with underscores ("_") for clarity, as " " is not a valid character in PuzzleScript maps by default.

This revision should resolve the errors related to map formatting and undefined symbols. Now the game should compile and run correctly.
