To fix the errors in your PuzzleScript game, we'll address the specific issues outlined in the console output:

1. **Sound error on line 63**: The sound declaration is incorrect. Since PuzzleScript does not support placeholder sounds, we'll remove the `SFX1` declaration unless you want to add actual sound events or objects later.

2. **Symbol errors in the levels**: The space character (`" "`) was incorrectly used in the levels as an empty space. In PuzzleScript, this should usually be a dot (`"."`) representing the Background.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

This corrected version should compile without errors. Note that the placeholder sound line was removed to prevent future issues related to sounds. If you plan to add sounds, ensure you use proper sound identifiers as described in the PuzzleScript documentation.
