It looks like there are issues with the comments and formatting in your PuzzleScript code. PuzzleScript does not support comments in the rules section, and that's causing errors. Here's a repaired version of your code without comments in the problematic sections:

I removed the comments from the rules section. Comments in PuzzleScript can only be placed outside of the rules section; for example, at the beginning of the file or between sections.
