The error messages indicate several issues with the provided PuzzleScript code:

1. **Sprite size errors:** Sprite graphics must be exactly 5x5.
2. **Map errors:** The map uses spaces (symbol " ") that are not defined.
3. **Rule errors:** There are issues with the rule syntax, causing problems with interpretation.
4. **Non-existent rule:** There is a rule written as a comment using `#`, which is not interpreted as a comment in PuzzleScript.

Below is a corrected version of the code:

### Changes Made:

1. **Sprite size:** Ensured all object sprites are 5x5.
2. **Space symbols:** Updated the level maps to use defined symbols for empty spaces (represented by ".").
3. **Removed erroneous line:** Removed the line starting with "#" to prevent the parser from attempting to parse it as a rule.
4. **Checked rule syntax:** Made sure all rules have correct syntax with arrows and proper pattern matching length on both sides. 

With these fixes, the game should compile and function properly.
