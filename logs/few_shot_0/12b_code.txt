Certainly! Let's address each error one by one:

1. **Line 72 error**: The section under `SOUNDS` should be commented out entirely or correctly used. Since it's intentionally left blank, let's ensure it's properly commented.

2. **Line 78 error**: The `Background` object needs to be in a layer by itself. This requires modifying the `COLLISIONLAYERS`.

3. **Line 104 and 111 errors**: The underscore ` _ ` representing `Empty` is being used improperly in the map. In PuzzleScript, empty spaces are just left as spaces, so let's remove the underscores from the map.

Here's the corrected code:

Explanation:
- In `COLLISIONLAYERS`, `Background` is in its own layer.
- `Empty`, indicated by `_`, is retained but isn't directly used in level maps.
- The underscores in the maps have been converted to spaces to properly represent empty tiles.

This should rectify the reported issues and allow the game to function correctly.
