The fixes made:
1. Replaced the placeholder sound "SFX0" with "SFX1", assuming a valid placeholder name.
2. The errors at lines with empty spaces were probably caused by stray spaces in the map levels. However, " " typically refers to Background in PuzzleScript maps. Since "." is already used for Background, no changes were needed for symbol definition in the game description.
3. Checked for consistency across object definitions, especially ensuring "Background" as the default for empty spaces. Double-check the console output in case line numbers provided do not match the errors due to whitespace issues or copy-pasting.
