The errors in your code stem from a couple of issues. First, in the SOUNDS section, there was a reference to a missing placeholder that I've now removed entirely, which should solve the parsing error for the sound event. Second, you used a space character for empty tiles in the levels, but this space was not defined in your OBJECTS or LEGEND sections. To fix this, we should use the Background object to represent empty spaces.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```

This version should compile without errors, as follows: 
- Removed the SOUNDS section that was causing a parsing issue (left intentionally blank to avoid similar errors).
- Updated the level maps to use the `.` character for the Background, as defined in the LEGEND section, instead of using spaces. 

Try running this code; it should now work correctly!
