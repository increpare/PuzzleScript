The errors in the console output indicate that the game code is trying to use a color index that doesn't exist in the defined palettes for the Tree and Bear objects. In PuzzleScript, color indices start at 0, so with only two colors defined, you can use indices 0 and 1. Let's fix the Tree and Bear object sprite definitions to only use available color indices.

Here's your corrected game code:

In the revised code, I've updated the sprite patterns for the `Tree` and `Bear` objects to ensure that they only use the color indices 0 and 1. This should address the compilation errors you were encountering.
