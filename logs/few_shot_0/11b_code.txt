The errors in the code can be fixed by addressing the following issues:
1. In PuzzleScript, you need to explicitly define empty spaces. The typical convention is to define a symbol like `empty` to denote this.
2. Add an explicit SOUND section with correct syntax to avoid the error message, though it's safe to keep it blank if not needed.

Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

```

Now, `Empty` is added to the `LEGEND` and used in the levels to represent spaces where nothing is present, fixing the errors for lines 95 and 102. The game should now compile without errors.
