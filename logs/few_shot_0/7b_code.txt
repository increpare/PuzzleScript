Certainly! Let's address the issues described in the console output:

1. **Sound Section**: PuzzleScript expects valid sound object names or events like `SFX3` and `ENDLEVEL`. I'll add a dummy sound to resolve this.
   
2. **Spacing in Levels**: In PuzzleScript, you use `.` or other defined symbols to represent spaces. The errors suggest an issue with using space characters, so let's replace them with `.`.

3. **Rule Patterns Mismatch**: Ensure that left and right sides of rules have patterns of equal length (number of cells).

Here's the corrected version of your game code:
