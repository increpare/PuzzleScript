Certainly! The errors in your PuzzleScript code are due to incorrect order of sections and incorrect usage of case-sensitive object names in the rules. Here's a revised version of the code that should resolve these issues:

Changes made:

1. Added a `SOUNDS` section above the `COLLISIONLAYERS` as required, even if it's empty.
2. Ensured that object names in the rules are capitalized to match the `LEGEND` definitions, respecting PuzzleScript's case sensitivity.
