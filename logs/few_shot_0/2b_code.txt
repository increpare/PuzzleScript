### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Sound Section Removed**: The `SOUNDS` section along with the usage in rules was removed because PuzzleScript does not support sounds. The syntax `SFX collect` was causing errors, so it has been removed from the rules as well.

2. **Sprite Size Correction**: The `Player` sprite was originally not 5x5. Adjusted the sprite to be 5 wide and 5 high by adding empty spaces to complete the dimensions.

3. **Level Formatting**: Ensured all maps in the `LEVELS` section are rectangular. Added necessary `.` (Background) characters to ensure all rows have an equal number of columns, making the maps consistent in size.

4. **Symbol Declaration**: Removed spaces from the map as PuzzleScript only recognizes declared characters as legitimate map elements. Spaces between cells have been replaced with `.` to indicate Background.

The game should now work correctly with these changes.
