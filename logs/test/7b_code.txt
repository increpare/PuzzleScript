To repair the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to remove the comments from the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript does not use `//` for comments, which resulted in a syntax error. By removing the comment, we prevent any misinterpretation by the PuzzleScript compiler. Here is the corrected code:

The code is now corrected by removing the comment line that was not compatible with the PuzzleScript language. This should prevent the syntax errors and allow the game to run correctly.
