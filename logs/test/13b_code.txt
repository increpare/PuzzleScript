The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code arise from the use of comments. The PuzzleScript language doesn't natively support comment syntax like `//` which is common in many other programming languages. To fix this, we need to remove any comment-like syntax or the comments themselves to prevent them from causing parsing errors.

Here's the corrected code with the comments removed:

This version of the script should compile without errors, as we have removed the non-supported comment syntax. If you want to add documentation or notes, consider keeping them in a separate file or online document for reference.
