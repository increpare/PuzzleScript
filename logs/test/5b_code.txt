Sure! The errors indicate problems with color definitions and the order of sections. Here's a plan to address these issues:

1. **Color Definition for Objects**: Ensure that "Gem" has correctly defined colors. Change `LightCyan` and `Teal` to the appropriate format or valid colors within the system's color palette. Removing spaces before and after color names can ensure cleaner code.

2. **Missing SOUNDS Section**: Add an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section, as all sections must be declared even if they aren't used.

3. **Re-check and Update**: After addressing the color and the section order issues, verify the rest of the code for consistency.

### Explanation:
- The colors for the `Gem` object were modified to `Cyan` and `DarkCyan`, assuming they are valid colors within the system.
- An empty `SOUNDS` section was added to maintain the proper syntax and sequence expected by the compiler.
- All other sections have been retained in their original form and order, ensuring that the game logic and levels remain intact.
