The errors in the console output indicate a couple of issues with the provided game code. Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to address them:

1. **Unrecognized stuff in the prelude:** There appears to be an issue with the prelude line at the beginning of the file. The most likely problem is the `zoom_screen 2` line, which is not a recognized element in PuzzleScript. It should be removed because the zoom screen is usually controlled by the PuzzleScript engine itself.

2. **Wall sprite color error:** It seems there's a mismatch between the color attributes for the "Wall" object. The Wall sprite's art is using numbers (indices) that reference colors, yet only one color is defined in the `Wall` object. We need to have a color for each layer represented in the sprite's pattern, which means more color instructions than just `Brown` are necessary.

By addressing these issues, here is the corrected version of the code:

### Changes Made:
- Removed the `zoom_screen 2` instruction.
- Added `DarkBrown` as a secondary color for the Wall object to account for multiple color layers needed for the sprite pattern.

This version of the game code should compile without errors and retain the intended functionality.
