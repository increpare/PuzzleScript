To repair the PuzzleScript game code and ensure it is functional, I need to address the errors presented in the console output. Here's the plan:

1. **Define Objects**: The game code is missing an "OBJECTS" section. I need to define objects like the player, goal, wall, and any other elements appearing in the level. This involves specifying colors and patterns for each object. 

2. **Collision Layers**: Define "COLLISIONLAYERS" where objects interact with each other. This is crucial for gameplay to work as intended, allowing defined interactions between objects.

3. **Legend Definitions**: Define "LEGEND" to assign symbols used in levels to the objects defined. Particularly for 'P' (Player), '.' (Background), '#' (Wall), 'G' (Goal), and 'E' (Exit or another specified object).

4. **Win Conditions**: Specify the "WINCONDITIONS". From the level, it seems like reaching 'G' could be a win condition.

5. **Level Definitions**: Ensure the level is defined correctly under the "LEVELS" section, now supplemented with necessary objects definitions and conditions.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

```

This code should now compile without errors and function correctly as a simple block-pushing game, with the win condition being to get the player, 'P', onto the goal, 'G'.
