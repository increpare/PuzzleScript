To address the errors in the provided game code, we need to correct the color definitions for the sprites that are causing issues, specifically, the `Wall` and `Player`. The error messages indicate that the `Wall` and `Player` objects are trying to use multiple colors, but the color palette provided only specifies one color for each. Therefore, we should adjust the color definitions to correctly match their intended designs, using multiple colors as necessary.

Here's the plan to fix the issues:

1. **Wall Object:** The error mentions that there is only one defined color index but multiple colors seem to be expected based on the pattern provided, implying the intention is to use more than one color. Adjust the `Wall` object to use a consistent brown shading, since all cells have the same 1 indicating a uniform color.
   
2. **Player Object:** Similarly to the Wall, the Player's color pattern suggests multiple colors are necessary to form a diffent look. Update the Player object to contain a suitable range of colors.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

Now the objects `Wall` and `Player` have color definitions consistent with their respective patterns. Ensure any additional game logic intended for goals or exits to be implemented if needed for interaction.
