To repair the given PuzzleScript game code, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Player Sprite Colors:** Adjust the player's color count to ensure there are only three colors defined. The game's code currently tries to use a fourth color (3), which doesnâ€™t exist. We need to remove any reference to a non-existent color.

2. **Gem Sprite Colors:** There are issues with the color definition for the `Gem`. The error suggests the color names might be incorrect according to PuzzleScript's color names. I will ensure both colors used in the `Gem` object are valid PuzzleScript color names.

3. **Palette Usage Check:** PuzzleScript has a specific set of predefined color names, and it's possible that names like `cyan` and `darkcyan` aren't recognized. I'll replace them with valid names like `LightCyan` and `Teal` from the PuzzleScript color list.

4. **Clean Up Errors:** Ensure that the definitions, rules, and win conditions are correctly formatted and declared to avoid syntax or logical errors.

Here's the corrected game code:

In this corrected version:

- I've ensured the `Player` object uses only the three defined colors without referencing a nonexistent fourth color.
- I've replaced `Cyan` and `DarkCyan` with valid PuzzleScript colors `LightCyan` and `Teal`.
- This should resolve the compilation errors and allow the game to function as intended.
