To address the errors reported in the console output for the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the main issues and the fixes required:

1. **Player Sprite Color Palette Error**: The sprite for the `Player` object is using index 3 in its color grid, but the palette only defines three colors, meaning the indices available are 0, 1, and 2. We need to adjust the sprite to not use the index 3 or add an additional color.

2. **Gem Sprite Color Errors**: The sprite colors for the `Gem` object are incorrectly defined with spaces or possibly incorrect capitalization. We'll need to ensure colors are properly defined and match valid color names recognized by PuzzleScript.

After understanding these issues, we can proceed with the corrections:

- For the `Player`, either modify the sprite to use only colors 0, 1, and 2, or add another color to the palette.
- For the `Gem`, ensure that colors are without extra spaces and are valid names.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

**Explanations of Fixes:**

- **Player**: Adjusted the color indices used in the last two rows of the sprite to fit within the palette of 3 colors (`Black`, `Yellow`, `White`), changing index `3` to `2`.
  
- **Gem**: Removed any trailing spaces from `LightCyan` and ensured `Teal` is recognized as a valid color name.

This adjustment should resolve the issues, allowing the game to compile and run correctly.
