To solve the reported error in the provided PuzzleScript code, we first need to understand the error message:

```
line 73 : In a rule, each pattern to match on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length (number of cells).
```

This error indicates that the rule defined is not properly structured. In PuzzleScript, rules have a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). Both sides should have an equal number of cells. In the rule provided:

```
[ Player | Goal ] -> [ Player ]
```

The issue is that there are two cells defined on the LHS (`Player` and `Goal`), but only one cell on the RHS (`Player`). The correct way to handle such a pattern is to ensure symmetry between LHS and RHS. The rule likely intends to allow the Player to stand on the Goal without changing any Game State, thus we should keep both objects in place on the RHS:

```
[ Player | Goal ] -> [ Player | Goal ]
```

This change ensures that the number of cells match on both sides.

Let's also verify other parts of the script for correctness like win conditions and map layout. The goal of the game appears to be to have the Player on all the Goal spots. Since the exit tile (`E`) likely signifies an endpoint, it should be part of the win condition, but it appears unused here. If the original intention was for Player to exit reach the Exit, the condition should use the Exit.

Here's a revised version of the script:

This ensures that the rule pattern matches correctly and the game should not error out during compilation.
