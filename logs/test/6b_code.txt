Upon reviewing the console output errors, here are the steps needed to correct the issues in the PuzzleScript game code:

1. **Color Specification for Gems**: The error message indicates that there was an incorrect color definition for "GEM". In PuzzleScript, colors need to be defined explicitly in the format of `PRIMARY [SECONDARY]` within the color palette provided.

2. **Invalid Rule Commenting**: The inline comment using `//` in the rules section is causing an error. In PuzzleScript, comments don't start with `//`. Comments should be outside the logical sections, typically at the top or between logical sections with a single line.

3. **Color Definitions**: Colors such as "Cyan" and "DarkCyan" need to be part of the color format PuzzleScript uses, or they should be defined using hexadecimal color codes if custom colors are desired.

Plan of Action:
- Correct the color definitions of the "Gem" object by choosing appropriate colors from PuzzleScript's defined colors or assign them actual hex color codes.
- Remove the inline comment within the rules section to avoid the error.
  
Here is the corrected version of the code:
