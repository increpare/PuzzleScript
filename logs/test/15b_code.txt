Certainly! Let's make sure the level is solvable by adding some rules or adjusting the level layout. Here's a revised version of the game code:

In this revision, we've removed the `Exit` as it wasn't contributing to the solvability, and ensured there are goals available for the player to move onto. The level has been adjusted so that the player can reach each goal position. Make sure to place "G" goal tiles strategically so the player can move onto them to satisfy the win condition.
