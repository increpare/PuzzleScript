I fixed the issue by ensuring there are movements possible for the player to reach the goal. The original configuration didn't violate any syntax rule, but needed a clearer path to guarantee the player could reach the Goal to command actions toward the win condition, in this case, you can freely just remove the `[ Player | Goal ] -> [ Player | Goal ]` line as it was breaking no rules. The rule 'allow movement' was implicitly not allowing it causing `Player` not to trigger the Win Condition. You did have background and movements implied by the player, but without rules for the game to understand what to perform or check within Player and Goal interactions, the game couldn't propagate direction outputs to allow Player to reach Goal.

You can make multiple combinations to allow movement, or even build specific levels for it where the player can reach the goal to satisfy win conditions.
