The errors in the code need addressing in order to get the game to compile correctly. Here's the plan to address them:

1. **Color Palette Error for "Goal":**
   - The current sprite definition for "Goal" attempts to use a color palette index that exceeds its defined colors. This happens because "Goal" has only one color defined (lightblue), yet attempts to use multiple indices which don't exist.
   - To fix this, we will redefine "Goal" using a proper color pattern or add more detailed designs using available color patterns. Since the game does not have additional colors beyond lightblue, we can create an art with only that color or include another color from the palette if needed.

2. **COLLISIONLAYERS Order Error:**
   - The COLLISIONLAYERS section is stated to be out of order and must be placed after the SOUNDS section.
   - We will add an empty SOUNDS section before COLLISIONLAYERS to adhere to the order requirement.

With these in mind, here's the corrected game code:

Explanation of changes:
- Updated "Goal" to a pattern with the single color to avoid palette index errors.
- Inserted an empty "SOUNDS" section before "COLLISIONLAYERS" to comply with the required order of these sections.
