The provided console output indicates there are issues with the sprite color codes in the PuzzleScript code. When a sprite is defined, it's composed of a grid with numbers referring to different colors. The error messages suggest that the specified color codes exceed the available ones defined for both `Background` and `Key` sprites.

Here's a breakdown of the steps to resolve the errors:

1. **Background Sprite**: In the `Background` sprite, multiple color numbers (1) are specified, but only one color (`lightgrey`) is defined. Since the numbers are out of range, we need to correct the sprite definition to use only the available color, which is `0`.

2. **Key Sprite**: Similar issue with the `Key` sprite, where the assigned numbers (`1`) exceed the number of defined colors (only one is defined: `yellow`). Hence, we should substitute them with `0`.

3. Correct the `BACKGROUND` and `KEY` sprite definitions to utilize their single available color. The code will be updated to reflect these changes.

Here is the repaired version of the code:

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Background**: Replaced all `1` with `0` since there's only one color (`lightgrey`).
- **Key**: Altered `1` to `0` to ensure only the available color (`yellow`) is referenced. 

With these adjustments, all sprite definitions now use valid indices for their color palettes, addressing the compilation errors.
