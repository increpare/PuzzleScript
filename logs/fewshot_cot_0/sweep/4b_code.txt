The error messages indicate that the PuzzleScript game engine is not recognizing the comments (`//`) placed after the sound declarations in the `SOUNDS` section. PuzzleScript doesn't support comments in the middle of syntax constructs such as sound declarations.

To address this problem, we'll remove the comments `//` from the sound declarations. This will comply with the syntax rules of PuzzleScript and eliminate the errors observed in the console output.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

This version should compile without errors and work as expected. The sound declarations now correctly lack comments, which was causing the syntactical issue.
