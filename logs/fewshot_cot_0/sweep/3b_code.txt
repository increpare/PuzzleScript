To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, let's break down the necessary fixes:

1. **Sprites Requirements**: Each sprite should be 5x5. The current `Key` sprite is 4x4, which needs to be increased to fit the required dimensions.
2. **Sound Verbs**: The code uses non-standard sound verbs like `Say` and `Win`, which should be replaced with valid sound verbs such as `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`, etc.
3. **Sound Definitions**: In PuzzleScript, sound definitions in the `SOUNDS` section don't include actions like `PickUp`, `Open`, or `Win`. Instead, sounds should be tied to actions with their respective sound IDs.
4. **Malformed Cell Rule**: The use of `Say` in the rules is incorrect. If you want sound to play upon actions, you should use the `sfxX` syntax where `X` is a sound index.
5. **Win Condition**: The win condition checks if the `Player` is on `OpenDoor`, but doesn't state this condition correctly in natural language.
6. **Remove syntax errors related to sound tokens and command misunderstandings in rules**.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Changes Made:
- The `Key` sprite size was corrected to 5x5.
- Sound definitions in the `SOUNDS` section were updated with appropriate sound IDs, and the rules now use `sfxX` syntax to trigger them.
- The natural language in the win condition was clarified to match the logic, using `Some` to indicate the presence of players on open doors.

These changes are intended to fix the syntax errors and adhere to PuzzleScript's requirements, allowing the game to run without compilation issues.
