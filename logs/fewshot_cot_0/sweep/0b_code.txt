**Plan of Action:**

1. **Define Title and Author**: Name the game and credit the creator (which would be us in this case).
   
2. **Objects Section**:
   - Define at least three to four game objects, one of which must be the player. Include obstacles, movable items, and targets if necessary.
   
3. **Legend Section**:
   - Map symbols to objects for easy referencing throughout the rule definition and level creation.
   
4. **CollisionLayers Section**:
   - Determine how objects will interact and stack with each other in the game grid.
   
5. **Rules Section**:
   - Define game mechanics, such as player movement and interactions with other game objects.
   
6. **WinConditions Section**:
   - Define what constitutes winning the game, such as reaching an exit.
   
7. **Levels Section**:
   - Create at least one game level displaying the initial setup of objects as represented in the Legend section.

8. **Sounds Section**:
   - Define game sound effects (though optional, it's good practice to differentiate actions by sounds).
