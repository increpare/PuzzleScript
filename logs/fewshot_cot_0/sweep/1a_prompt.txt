(Adds a DidNotMove to where the player currently is, to cancel moves where they bump into a wall.)

[Player] -> [Player DidNotMove]

[ > Warpball | Static] [Wizard] -> [ | Static ] [> Wizard]
[ > Warpball | Moveable ] [Wizard] -> [ | Wizard Sfx0] [Moveable] (Wizards telexport. What they really do is shoot a "warpball", which causes them to move normally if it hits a wall and warp if it hits something they can warp with.)

(The following mess is for changing characters.)
[ Action Fighter] [SThief] -> [SFighter] [Thief Sfx1]
[ Action Thief] [SWizard] -> [SThief] [Wizard Sfx1]
[ Action Wizard] [SPriest] -> [SWizard] [Priest Sfx1]

[ Action Priest] [no SFighter] [no SThief] [SWizard] -> [SPriest] [no SFighter] [no SThief] [Wizard Sfx1]

(Cancels the move if the player is in the same place that they started. Notice that switching characters negates this. Only matters in levels where one dragon has multiple targets.)

Late [Player DidNotMove] -> Cancel
Late [DidNotMove] -> []

(Now enemies attack.)

Late [DragonLeft] -> [LFireball DragonLeft]
Late [DragonRight] -> [RFireball DragonRight]

Late LEFT [LFireball | Invulnerable] -> [ | Invulnerable]

Late [Goblin | Vulnerable] -> [Goblin | Dying Vulnerable]

(Vulnerable objects that are attacked are designated as "Dying", but heroes can be saved by the Priest. Then the stuff that didn't get saved dies.)

Late [Dying Healer] -> [Saved Healer]
Late [Healer | Dying Hero] -> [Healer | Saved Hero]
Late [Dying Monster] -> [Sfx5]

late [ShadowDoor] [Monster] -> [MonsterDoor] [Monster]

(Looks for a HasSaved on a wall and moves it to the Priest. Then, if someone was saved this turn, plays the sound only if the Priest doesn't have the HasSaved note. Finally, cleans that up.)
