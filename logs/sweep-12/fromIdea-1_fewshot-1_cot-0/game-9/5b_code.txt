Here's how you can address the issues and make the game work correctly. The main problems in your code were related to using a color index that was not defined in the "Flag" object's color palette and the lack of a defined background. Here's the corrected version:

The changes made:

1. The `Flag` object color pattern was adjusted to use colors `1` in the pattern since the original pattern referenced a non-existent color `2`.

2. The `Empty` object has been designated as the game background with a specific color to avoid compilation errors related to undefined backgrounds. 

These adjustments should solve the issues and allow your game to compile and run correctly.
