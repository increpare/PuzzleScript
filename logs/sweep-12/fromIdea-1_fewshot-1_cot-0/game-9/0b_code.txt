This simplified `Tile Tactics Demake` gives the player control of a single unit that can move around to capture flags. The enemy is non-interactive but symbolically blocks passage to increase the complexity of reaching flags. The game is a basic representation of strategic movement and goal achievement in a tile-based format.
