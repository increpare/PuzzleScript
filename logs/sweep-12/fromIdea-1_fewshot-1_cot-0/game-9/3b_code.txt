The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect color palette definitions for the `Terrain` and `Enemy` objects. Here is a corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
1. The `Terrain` sprite changed to entirely use background color with all dots in its bitmap design, correcting the color number access errors.
2. Fixed the `Enemy` sprite design to match the defined colors to prevent `color number` access errors. 

Now the code should compile without errors, creating a simplified, tactical game where players can move across a grid to capture flags while avoiding enemies.
