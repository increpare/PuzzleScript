Here is a repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issues with color definitions have been addressed, ensuring the game compiles and functions correctly. I also made sure the game aligns with the idea of commanding armies in a simplistic manner:

In this version, I've slightly adjusted the sprite definitions to ensure they're correctly using the color index. Additionally, the appearance of player and enemy sprites was tweaked to use their colors properly. This should resolve the reported compilation errors.
