message Welcome to Time Trinkle! Flip tiles to their proper place in time.

Changes made:
1. Moved the `Player` layer above the `CurrentTile` in `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
2. Fixed the sound command syntax by referencing the sound name directly in the rules instead of `SFX0`. 
3. Fixed the win condition to use the object name `Tile_Present` instead of the descriptive name `Present`.
