  ENDGAME ANIMATIONS

(play the sound effect when infection begins)
[ NonCursorPlayer CrateInfectionSeed ] -> [ Crate CrateInfectionSeed ] SFX9

(infection radiation)
[ CrateInfectionSeed | no CrateInfectionComplete no Space ] -> [ CrateInfectionSeed | CrateInfectionTemp ] again
[ CrateInfectionSeed ] -> [ CrateInfectionComplete ]

(when the infection hits a specified trigger tile, move on to the next level; due to the object limit, I'm using EditModeDrop for this)
[ CrateInfectionComplete EditModeDrop ] -> [ CrateInfectionComplete EditModeDrop ] win

(infection tile transformations)
late [ CrateInfectionTemp BlueSky ] -> [ CrateInfectionTemp CrateInfection ]
late [ CrateInfectionTemp Transformable ] -> [ CrateInfectionTemp Crate ]

( =========
  EDIT MODE
  ========= )

(hitting the X key when in the normal game activates the edit mode)
[ EditModeDrop Space ] UP [ ACTION NonCursorPlayer | ... | EditModeDrop ] -> [ EditModeDrop Space ] [ ACTION NonCursorPlayer | ... | EditModeDrop EditModeCursor ] SFX1
[ EditModeDrop Space ] [ ACTION NonCursorPlayer ] -> [ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ ACTION NonCursorPlayer ]
[ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ ACTION PlayerLeft ] -> [ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ PlayerLeftDisabled ]
[ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ ACTION PlayerRight ] -> [ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ PlayerRightDisabled ]
[ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ ACTION PlayerLadder ] -> [ EditModeDrop EditModeArrow ] [ PlayerLadderDisabled ]

(hitting the X key while in edit mode returns to platform control)

[ ACTION EditModeCursor ] [ PlayerRightDisabled ] -> [ ACTION EditModeCursor ] [ PlayerRight ]
[ ACTION EditModeCursor ] [ PlayerLadderDisabled ] -> [ ACTION EditModeCursor ] [ PlayerLadder ]
[ ACTION EditModeCursor ] -> [ ] SFX4

(restrict the cursor's movement)
HORIZONTAL [ > EditModeCursor | no EditModeArrow ] -> [ EditModeCursor | no EditModeArrow ]
[ UP EditModeCursor ] -> [ EditModeCursor ]

( {1} )
(Hitting the down arrow in edit mode drops a crate. The rule that does this is further down so that it happens after the normal gravity assertion; if it were here, the crate would fall one row before drawing and would appear to start on the second row from the top.

Search for {2} to find the rule.)



( ===============
  NORMAL MOVEMENT
  =============== )

(forces another turn after player movement to assert gravity)
[ MOVING NonCursorPlayer ] -> [ MOVING NonCursorPlayer ] again

(Change the player's orientation based on movement.)
[ LEFT NonCursorPlayer ] -> [ LEFT PlayerLeft ]
[ RIGHT NonCursorPlayer ] -> [ RIGHT PlayerRight ]
late [ NonCursorPlayer Ladder ] -> [ PlayerLadder Ladder ]

(shove crates)
HORIZONTAL [ > NonCursorPlayer | Crate ] -> [ > NonCursorPlayer | > Crate ]

(level 2 ends when you grab the orb)

(burn some crates)
[ BurntCrate ] -> [ ]
[ BurningCrate ] -> [ BurntCrate ] again
[ BurntCrate | Crate ] -> [ BurntCrate | BurningCrate ]
DOWN [ Crate no CrateInfection | Fire ] -> [ BurningCrate | Fire ] SFX8 again



( ==================
  CLIMBING & GRAVITY
  ================== )

(A player can climb on top of a crate by walking into it or pressing up while facing it, but only if there's something on the other side of the crate so the player can't push it, and also if there's nothing above the player or the crate. Done by using a temporary player object that moves up if there's no obstacle above and then moves on top of the crate if there's no obstacle there.)
RIGHT [ > NonCursorPlayer | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | Crate | Solid ]
RIGHT [ ^ PlayerRight | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | Crate | Solid ]
UP [ PlayerJumpRight | no Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpRight | v PlayerRight ]
LEFT [ > NonCursorPlayer | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | Crate | Solid ]
LEFT [ v PlayerLeft | Crate | Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | Crate | Solid ]
UP [ PlayerJumpLeft | no Solid ] -> [ PlayerJumpLeft | ^ PlayerLeft ]

(don't let the player move up or down unless they're on a ladder)
[ UP NonCursorPlayer no Ladder ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer no Ladder ]

(assert gravity)
DOWN [ STATIONARY Crate ] -> [ > Crate ] again
DOWN [ STATIONARY NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | no Ladder ] -> [ > NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | no Ladder ] again

(get keys and unlock goals; happens after gravity so you can fall on keys)
HORIZONTAL DOWN [ > NonCursorPlayer | Key ] [ GoalLocked ] -> [ > NonCursorPlayer | ] [ Goal ] SFX7

(Clean up after jumping.)
(If the player is on top of a temporary jump token, then the player moved up but was blocked by an obstacle on top of the crate, so move the player back down.)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer | PlayerJump ] -> [ | NonCursorPlayer ]
(If the player and the temporary jump token both exist here, then the player jumped successfully. Clear the token and destroy the crumbling floor if the player was standing on one.)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ PlayerJump | Crumble ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ | ] SFX5 SFX2
late [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ PlayerJump ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer ] [ ] SFX5
(If there's a temporary jump token remaining here, then the player tried jumping but was blocked from above. Turn the token back into the player.)
late [ PlayerJumpLeft ] -> [ PlayerLeft ]
late [ PlayerJumpRight ] -> [ PlayerRight ]



( =============
  MISCELLANEOUS
  ============= )

( {2} )
(Hitting X over one of the arrows in edit mode drops a crate. Search for {1} for an explanation of why this rule is here after gravity.)
DOWN [ DOWN EditModeCursor | no Thing ] -> [ EditModeCursor | Crate ] SFX3 again
[ DOWN EditModeCursor ] -> [ EditModeCursor ]

(win condition; player must be standing on solid ground to enter the goal)
late DOWN [ NonCursorPlayer Goal | Solid ] -> [ NonCursorPlayer Goal | Solid ] SFX0 win

(crumble breakable floors if the player is walking away after standing on one; happens after pushing, climbing, & gravity)
DOWN [ PERPENDICULAR NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | Crumble ] -> [ PERPENDICULAR NonCursorPlayer no Ladder | ] SFX2

WINCONDITIONS

(win condition is a rule to enforce that the player must be stationary on the goal)

RULES

[ > player ] [ stationary shadow ] -> [ > player ] [ < shadow ]

( 1. Propagate movements forward )
[ > Mover | stationary Movable ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable  ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box    ] [ > Box    ]
+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate  ] [ > Crate  ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest  ] [ > Chest  ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 2. Propagate obstructions backwards )
[ > Mover  | stationary Obstacle ] -> [ stationary Mover | Obstacle ]
+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate ] [ Crate ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ stationary Box   ] [ Box   ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ stationary Chest ] [ Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ stationary Glue | Glue ]

( 3. remove all movement, keep a flag )
[ > Movable ] -> [ Movable wanna_move ]

( 4. propagate movement only on wanna_move things )
(    ie redo step 1 but with WANNA_MOVE added to the first line below )
[ > Mover  | stationary Movable WANNA_MOVE ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable ]
+ [ > Box   ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box   ] [ > Box   ]
+ [ > Crate ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate ] [ > Crate ]
+ [ > Chest ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest ] [ > Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 5. cleanup, remove flag )
[ wanna_move ] -> [ ]

USER PROMPT:
Output the code for a complete PuzzleScript game. The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Time Trinkle:** Manipulate time by flipping tiles forward or backward, solving paradox puzzles to restore history in a fractured world..  Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
