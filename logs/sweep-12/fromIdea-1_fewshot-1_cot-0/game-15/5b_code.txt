### Changes Made:
1. **Sprite Size Correction**: Ensured that all sprite descriptions are exactly 5x5 pixels, which is a requirement in PuzzleScript.
2. **Rule Syntax Correction**: Replaced `endlevel` with a proper command in a rule by using `again` so that it triggers an action. But ensure end level trigger logic makes sense in your actual gameplay.
3. **Added Wall Graphics**: Provided a basic 5x5 sprite pattern for the Wall object. 

This should resolve the issues you faced regarding sprite size and syntax. You might need to further refine the game logic based on how it's supposed to operate.
