Here's the corrected version of your game code. I've addressed the errors and made a few adjustments to better align the descriptions and ensure the game compiles correctly:

### Changes Made:
1. **Target Color Definition**: Fixed the color definition of the `Target` object in the `OBJECTS` section to only use one color, as originally defined.
2. **Sounds**: Updated the sound name from an incorrect token to a standard `Player MOVE` sound for feedback, replacing the illegal custom sound definition.
3. **Graphic Definition**: Ensured that each object has a correct 5x5 pixel pattern and removed unnecessary patterns. Adjusted `Target` to have a valid pattern within its defined color limits.
4. **Rules Adjustments**: Retained existing logic to convert `ColorTile` into different `Revealed` states and allowed interaction with `Target`.

Feel free to expand upon this foundation with more objects and design patterns as needed for your game concept!
