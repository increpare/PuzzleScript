In this simplified game, the player must move onto the "ColorTile" to reveal different vibrant colors. Start as a black and white world, and by interacting with the tiles, unlock and reveal the hidden vibrant colors; once the final color is revealed, you can then reach the target to restore life to the haunted world. The game ends when the player reaches the target position.
