This revised version resolves the errors found in the original code:

- The keyword `v` was removed from the legend to avoid conflicts.
- The win condition now uses `BackgroundNeutral` and `BackgroundVibrant` instead of just `n` and `v`.
- Adjustments were made to ensure that each rule has patterns on both sides of equal length.
- Ensured a coherent game design by fixing syntax issues and errors in the rules that caused the game to misbehave.
