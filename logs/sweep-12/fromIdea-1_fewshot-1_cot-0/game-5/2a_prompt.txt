A port of the luxuriant Wanderlands game, Midas, with permission of the authors.  It's a bit messy, if you can find a way to tidy it UP, let me know : ] 

the original is here

update: uh, it's flash, so not a playable link any more...also the original developer site is gone.

produced the following console output:
=================================
line 41 : Was looking for color for object PLAYER, got "lightcyan" instead.
line 109 : Maps must be rectangular, yo (In a level, the length of each row must be the same).
you have to define something to be the background
line 85 : In a rule, each pattern to match on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length (number of cells).
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Haunted Hues:** Restore life to a desaturated, haunted world by unlocking vibrant color palettes hidden within cleverly camouflaged tiles.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
