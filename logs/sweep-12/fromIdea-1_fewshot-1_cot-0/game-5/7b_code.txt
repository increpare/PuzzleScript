This fixed version addresses the following issues:
1. Changed the object name from "T" to "t" and "A" to "a" to avoid using reserved keywords.
2. Added a proper background definition for easier checking of win conditions. (Changed the win condition to work with all "n" transformed into "v".)
3. Corrected the rule by ensuring the right side has a complete pattern to match the left side's object length and action pattern.
