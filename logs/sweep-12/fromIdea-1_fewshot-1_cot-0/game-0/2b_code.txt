Key changes include:
- Fixed the `Enemy` sprite definition by ensuring it only references defined color pixels.
- Removed an unnecessary comment line marked with `//` that was causing an error due to being misinterpreted as an object or rule. 

You can use this code to test and play the simplified "Crops & Castles" game in PuzzleScript.
