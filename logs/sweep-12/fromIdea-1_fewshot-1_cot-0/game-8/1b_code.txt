Here's the fixed PuzzleScript code with color and rule adjustments to align with PuzzleScript's requirements. I took the liberty to fix the issues highlighted in the console output:

Changes made:
- Corrected colors for `RecipeBook` to be valid PuzzleScript colors, using "black" and "brown".
- Removed redundant spaces from color values.
- Adjusted rules to maintain functionality and follow standard PuzzleScript conventions.
- Ensured the objects are properly declared with colors and updated game logic reflects the game idea.
