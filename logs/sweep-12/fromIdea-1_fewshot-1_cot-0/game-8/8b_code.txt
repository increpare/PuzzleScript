### Changes Made
1. **Level 1 Modification**: Moved the Player closer to the Olive to make it reachable.
2. **Ensure Accessibility**: The Player can navigate the entire grid to collect Olives and reach the Pot.
3. **Ensure Sufficient Ingredients**: Verify each level has enough Olives and access to a Pot to satisfy the win condition.

With these modifications, each level should now be solvable by ensuring that players can access the ingredients (Olives) and the tools (Pot) required to complete the objectives.
