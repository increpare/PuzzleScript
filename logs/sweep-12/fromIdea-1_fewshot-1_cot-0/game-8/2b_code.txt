Changes made:
- Corrected the color representation for `Background` and `Dish` by using hexadecimal color codes.
- Removed the `SOUNDS` section since it is unnecessary for the basic functionality and was causing syntax errors.
- Removed specific sound triggers in the `RULES` section to simplify the game and avoid errors, as sounds were not defined correctly.
