To ensure that each level is solvable, we need to adjust the positioning of the objects so that the player can reach the olives, the recipe book, and the pot for cooking. Here's the updated game code, ensuring each level's solvability:

### Changes Made:
1. **Level 1**: Moved the player and the olive closer together and adjusted the pot's position so the player can interact with both the olive and the pot.
2. **Level 2**: Ensured that there is a clear path to all olives and the pot from the player's starting position. Placed the recipe book in a reachable location.
3. **Level 3**: Created a direct path from the player to the recipe book, olive, and pot to ensure the player can use the book and cook the dish. 

Each level is now designed such that the player can gather the olives and reach the pot while using the recipe book when needed.
