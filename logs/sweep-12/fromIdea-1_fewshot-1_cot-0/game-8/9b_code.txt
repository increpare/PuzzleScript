Changes made:
- Adjusted the positions of objects in Level 1 to ensure the player (P) can access the olive (O) and the pot (T).
- Ensured the conditions in Level 3 allow both the olive and pot to be reachable by the player.
- Updated the rule from `[ P | O | T ] -> [ P | D | T ]` to `[ P | T | no D ] -> [ P | D | T ]` to ensure that a dish (D) is created when the player is just in contact with the pot (T) provided there is no existing dish (D).
