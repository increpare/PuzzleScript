Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've ensured the section order is correct, object names are consistent, and there are no unnecessary sections. This simplified version of *Olive Odyssey* should focus on gathering olives and cooking them using a recipe book into a dish:

### Key Changes:
1. **Section Order**: Added an empty `SOUNDS` section, allowing `COLLISIONLAYERS` to be correctly ordered after it.
2. **Object Names**: Ensured the use of object names in the `RULES` section matches those defined in the `LEGEND` section.
3. **Simplification**: Maintained simplicity by focusing on basic interactions between objects without unnecessary complexity.
