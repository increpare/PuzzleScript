### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **MagicDish Color**: Fixed the MagicDish and RecipeBook color issue by aligning the sprite to use a properly defined color grid. The 5x5 grid is filled with `0` ensuring it has a defined color palette.
   
2. **Sound Declaration**: Removed the number `44735502` from the Olive PICKUP sound declaration, as it wasn't recognized, leaving it as a simple event trigger.

3. **Wall Definition**: Added `W = Wall` to the legend. Initially, the `#` key in the Wall definition was not referenced correctly in the level design. By ensuring `W` is defined as Wall, the game's validation can find it.

The repaired version should now compile without errors and represent a basic meets-goal PuzzleScript game based on the concept of "Olive Odyssey".
