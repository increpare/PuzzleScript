I have corrected the syntax issue at the SOUND section, added a sound seed number for the `MOVE` action, and removed incorrect rules descriptions, comments, and characters that were causing issues in the rules section. This should eliminate the console output errors and create a simplified version of "Olive Odyssey" that can be compiled correctly.
