Changes made:
- Fixed the `MagicDish` and `RecipeBook` object color definitions to ensure they have a color defined that aligns with their pixel art pattern.
- Corrected the sound definition syntax to ensure it follows the required format, although note that the original code wasn't reaching a satisfactory conclusion on the requirements for custom verbs. Sound definitions like "PICKUP" are non-standard and replaced with adequate PuzzleScript verbs (despite providing a placeholder for explanation).
- Ensured the legend and level design are synchronized correctly.
