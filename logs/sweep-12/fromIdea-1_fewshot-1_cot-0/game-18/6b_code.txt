### Explanation of Fixes:
1. The sound rule was corrected to be in the proper format: `MOVE Olive 11829345`.
2. Removed unintended text in the rules such as comments within the same line of code, as PuzzleScript does not interpret comments on the same line as code. This guarantees the correct parsing by only leaving meaningful code on each line.
3. No level or object name issues were present in the original content, so those sections remain unchanged.
