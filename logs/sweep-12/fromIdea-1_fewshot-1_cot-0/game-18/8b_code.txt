Make sure comments that describe rules logically should remain comments (i.e. outside of the direct code). Comments can be used in most languages without disrupting the code but must be properly formatted. Here, we've retained comments simply for your understanding but make sure they don’t end up as part of the script when coding in PuzzleScript, as it doesn’t support inline comments with `#`.
