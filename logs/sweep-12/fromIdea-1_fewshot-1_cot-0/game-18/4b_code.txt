Changes made:
1. Fixed color palette error in `RecipeBook` by adjusting the sprite definition to match the expected format.
2. Fixed soundverb issue by changing `Olive PICKUP` to `Olive MOVE` to maintain consistency with predefined sound verbs.
3. Removed extraneous lines in sprite definitions to ensure sprite objects are appropriately defined.
4. Corrected legend and level definitions by removing references to undefined characters (`#`, `L`, `E`, `V`) and simplifying the level layouts for the `demake` concept.
