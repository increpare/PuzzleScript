Changes made:
1. Corrected the sound declaration with the proper syntax.
2. Fixed the rule comments to avoid misinterpretation as code by ensuring no invalid tokens or words outside of the standard expectations.
3. Removed errors related to malformed comments and corrected them to standard comments using '#'.
