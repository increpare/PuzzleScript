Explanation of fixes:

1. Removed invalid comments and characters in the rules section that caused the parser errors. Comments should start with a `#` sign and should not contain `->` syntax inside them.
2. Made sure rules references match defined objects in `LEGEND`.
3. Corrected formatting of the `RULES` section to prevent parsing errors.
4. Verified alignment with the level design to ensure game mechanics function as intended.
