### Key Fixes & Adjustments:
1. **Object Definitions and Dimensions:**
   - Ensure that graphical representations (sprites) are 5x5.

2. **Sound Definitions:**
   - Update sound identifiers (`UnlockDoor`, `CollectTreasure`) to `Sfx1`, `Sfx2` which adhere to PuzzleScript standard naming conventions.

3. **Legend Definitions:**
   - Define all objects properly within the Legend section.

4. **Collision Layers Fix:**
   - Make sure `Trap` is only included in one layer.

5. **Rules Tweaks:**
   - Fix rules to ensure that player movements, traps, and interactions (e.g., picking up keys) are adequately processed.
   - Make the movement rules accurate to eliminate redundancy and align actions.

6. **Win Conditions Correction:**
   - Ensure the win condition is correct with `No Treasure`.

7. **Levels:**
   - Ensure each level map is rectangular for proper gameplay implementation.
   - Remove undefined symbols and redundant maps.
   - Maintain the Player, Treasures, and other elements within the map scale.

This repaired version should run the game without the encountered errors, respecting the intended gameplay mechanics previously defined.
