This simplified demake of "Puzzlot" includes the fundamental elements: a player, keys, crates, traps, doors, and treasures. The goal is for the player to collect all treasures while unlocking doors and avoiding traps. Note that this is an illustrative demake and doesnâ€™t feature procedural generation or advanced traps as described in the original game idea but serves as a basic foundation to build upon.
