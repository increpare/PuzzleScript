### Changes Made:
1. **Trap Collision Layers**: Removed 'Trap' from being an obstacle in the `Obstacle` legend to meet the collision layer rule, given it had its own layer due to its function.
2. **Sprite Correct Size**: Updated the sprite for 'Trap' with equal 5x5 size pattern.
3. **Rule Fix**: Ensured all rule patterns on the left have a corresponding right-side pattern of equal length, especially `[ > Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate ]`.
4. **Level Consistency**: Ensured the levels are of consistent size (rectangular shape).
5. **Game Logic Refinement**: Adjusted the rule for encountering a door to ensure consistency within desired behavior in the code.

This assumes 'Trap' is meant to remove crates, not function as an obstacle for the player. If traps should block movement or act differently, let me know, and I'd be happy to make further adjustments.
