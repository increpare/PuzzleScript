Here is a corrected version of the `Mechanimal` game code. The errors in the color definitions have been addressed, and the game should now compile without issues.

In this code, the issues with the color definitions for the `Mechanimal` and `Constructed` objects were corrected. The extra colors were removed, and each sprite now has a single color, which matches the number of colors that are referenced in their graphical representations.
