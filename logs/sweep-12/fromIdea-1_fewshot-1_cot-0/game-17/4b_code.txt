**Key Changes Made:**
1. **Player Object**: Added a 5x5 character design instead of a 3x3 one for consistency with other objects. Also corrected the format to include a full three-color row.
2. **Mechanimal Object**: Fixed the issue by changing the color definition format. Added a 5x5 character design and ensured the correct palette is used.
3. **Corrected the Color Definitions**: Objects like `Mechanimal` and `Player` now include proper graphical representation with three or fewer colors as needed.
4. **Ensured Compatibility**: Made sure every object has a completed pixel art design to prevent errors related to color referencing.

These changes should fix the errors mentioned, ensuring the game compiles successfully and follows the desired concept.
