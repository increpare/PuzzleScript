Below is a revised and corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The errors related to color palette issues and incorrect object definitions have been fixed. Additionally, this version simplifies the original concept into a functional demake:

Changes made:
- Corrected the color palette definition for `Player` and `Mechanimal` by properly defining them with existing and correct color codes.
- Adjusted the sprite for `Mechanimal` to use currently defined terms and colors.
- Fixed rules to align with the capabilities of the PuzzleScript engine, especially with the "late" rule procedure now correctly defined.
- Clarified and ensured all placeholder objects (like switches and bridges) are properly integrated within the collision and rule mechanics.
