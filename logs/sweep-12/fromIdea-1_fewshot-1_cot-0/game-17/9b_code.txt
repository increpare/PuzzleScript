### Key Fixes:
- Removed extra spaces in color names to ensure correct parsing.
- Fixed the console errors by ensuring that all objects have valid colors and patterns.

The game remains a simplified demake of the concept where you interact with mechanimals and manipulate them to help solve puzzles.
