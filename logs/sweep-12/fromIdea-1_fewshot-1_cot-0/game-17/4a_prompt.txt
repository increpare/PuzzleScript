too many errors, aborting compilation
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Mechanimal:** Befriend mechanical wildlife and construct them into powerful counterparts to solve environmental puzzles on a lost planet.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
