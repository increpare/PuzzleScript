### Corrections Made:
- Adjusted the color palette for the `Player` sprite to use only one base color since there were only two color definitions initially. 
- Simplified the `Player` sprite's pattern to ensure it only remains within the defined palette.
- Adjusted the `Mechanimal` sprite to use only one base color, similar to the `Player` sprite.

These changes should resolve the console errors and ensure that the game functions correctly as a simplified demake of the proposed Mechanimal game concept.
