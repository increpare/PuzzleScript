To address the errors in your PuzzleScript game code, I'll correct the color palette indices and ensure the sprite graphics are 5x5, as required. I will also adjust the rules so that they make sense in context and do not require impossible overlaps. Here's the revised code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Sprite Size**: Ensured that all sprites are 5x5.
2. **Color Palette Indices**: Fixed the color palette access for `Mechanimal` and `BuiltMechanimal` by ensuring the indices are properly aligned with the available colors.
3. **Logical Rules**: Slightly modified the rules to ensure that conditions are achievable based on the game logic described.
4. **Context**: Adjusted the game concept to align with a mechanical puzzle-solving theme.

This set of changes should address all compilation errors while staying true to the intended game mechanics.
