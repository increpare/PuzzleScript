### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Player Sprite Correction**:
   - Removed the excess color reference by adjusting the pattern for the `Player` sprite to ensure it only uses the two defined colors.

2. **Part Sprite Correction**:
   - Corrected the sprite pattern for `Part` to not reference unauthorized color indices.

These changes should address the errors and the game should compile and run correctly.
