The errors in the original code were as follows:
1. The `Mechanimal` sprite had color indexing issues because the palette was not defined correctly (it used color index 2 which was not defined). This has been fixed by adjusting the sprite colors to ensure they are within the defined indices.
2. The `Target` and `Mechanimal` sprites had incorrect formats for the color codes and shape, which have been corrected to follow the 5x5 grid requirement while ensuring proper color indexing.
