The errors in your PuzzleScript game code are mainly due to incorrect color references in the sprite definitions. Let's address those issues and correct the code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Player Sprite**: Reduced the third color reference as it was not used in the player's pattern.
2. **Part and Mechanimal Sprites**: Consolidated their colors since they did not require multiple colors as per their patterns.
3. **Removed Extra Colors**: Simplified the color usage in `Part` and `Mechanimal` since they didn't need more than one color based on the patterns provided.

The game should now compile without color palette issues, maintaining the core mechanics and objectives you planned.
