Here's the repaired version of the PuzzleScript code that addresses the errors you encountered. The errors were due to the use of more colors than defined in the sprite palettes. I have adjusted the color references in the `Mechanimal` and `BuiltMechanimal` objects to use the available colors in their respective palettes.

This code should now compile without errors. The game allows the player to move parts to build a path for the mechanimal and then transform it into a `BuiltMechanimal` when it encounters a part. The goal is to cover all targets with `BuiltMechanimal`.
