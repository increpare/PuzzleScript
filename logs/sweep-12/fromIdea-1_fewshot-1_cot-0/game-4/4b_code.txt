### Changes Made:
1. Changed the object name `V` to `TrackV` to avoid using reserved keywords.
2. Fixed incorrect rule syntax by capitalizing `Action` for interaction rules.
3. Cleaned up any reference to unexpected rule references not defined (e.g., `movement`, `#`).

This update should address the console errors and maintain the essence of the game, allowing track placement and train navigation.
