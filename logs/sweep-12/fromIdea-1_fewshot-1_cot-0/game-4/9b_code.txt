Changes made:
1. Updated vertical track placeholder to `|` for correct identification within puzzlescript.
2. Fixed incorrect references to reserved keywords and eliminated unnecessary comments and sections.
3. Modified rules under `RULES` for correct action detection and modified track placement logic to simplify track construction. 
4. Removed incorrect rules and cleaned up the code for clarity.
