too many errors, aborting compilation
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Railway Riddle:** Construct a seamless train track through challenging landscapes to connect distant towns before the clock runs out..
