Changes made:
1. Changed the commented lines to use `#` since they are just for your understanding and not executed as code.
2. Removed the invalid naming of objects using symbols such as `|` which conflicted with the PuzzleScript language's syntax.
3. Adjusted the references in the LEGEND section to use valid identifiers (e.g., `H = TrackH` to represent horizontal tracks).
4. Ensure game logic and readability are maintained with descriptive identifiers.
