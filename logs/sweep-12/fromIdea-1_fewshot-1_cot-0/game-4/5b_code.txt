**Key changes:**
- Changed `TrackV` to `|` in the legend to avoid using reserved keywords.
- Removed erroneous references to non-existent variables and comments that were improperly formatted.
- Rearranged rule comments to avoid incorrect placement that caused syntax errors. 

This simplified game allows you to place track tiles and guide the train to the towns by generating tracks as described in your win condition.
