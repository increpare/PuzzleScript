Key changes made:
1. Updated the placeholder `V` with `|` for vertical tracks to avoid the reserved keyword conflict.
2. Removed incorrect referencing to nonexistent objects in rules (such as `movement` and `placing` keywords).
3. Adjusted collision layers to combine Cursor, Track, and Train movement within the same layer. 
4. Added proper syntax in rules to match the action (lowercase `action` keyword).
5. Fixed casing consistency for all definitions.
