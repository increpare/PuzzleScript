### Key Fixes:
1. **Cursor Colors**: Adjusted the cursor to specify two colors.
2. **Keywords**: Removed the use of problematic keywords (`|`, `^`, `v`) from object names.
3. **Sound Tokens**: Removed unwanted sound references (`buildtrack`, `trainmove`) as these aren't present in the examples provided.
4. **Rule Corrections**: Simplified rules to manage the movement and placement of tracks without using unrecognized elements.
5. **Level Setup**: Corrected object definition in the level to ensure all symbols are defined properly.
