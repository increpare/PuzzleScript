The errors in the code were related to using prohibited symbols and referencing non-existent objects and comments incorrectly. Here's a revised version of the code. I've replaced the `|` character with `V` and updated the rules to align with proper PuzzleScript syntax. Also, I corrected the comment structure to stop rules from breaking.

This code should now compile correctly. Note that constructing seamless tracks may require additional rules and game logic, especially if you want to introduce time constraints or more complex track-building mechanics.
