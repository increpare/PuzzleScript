Here is a repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the errors and made some necessary adjustments for the game to function correctly:

Key Changes Made:
1. Changed the legend definition for `Cursor` from `P` to `C` to avoid the reserved keyword conflict and adjusted the rules accordingly.
2. Each rule has been simplified to match this new setup, which includes how tracks are placed and the train's movement.
3. Adjusted `TrackL` and `TrackR` patterns for visual clarity based on the specific curve definitions.

This code should set you up with a basic "construct the track" type of game, with simplified mechanics. Adjust the mechanics as needed to expand on this foundation.
