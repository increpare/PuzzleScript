(

A port of the luxuriant Wanderlands game, Midas, with permission of the authors.  It's a bit messy, if you can find a way to tidy it UP, let me know : ] 

the original is here
https://web.archive.org/web/20120219201941/http://wanderlands.org/main/midas

update: uh, it's flash, so not a playable link any more...also the original developer site is gone.
