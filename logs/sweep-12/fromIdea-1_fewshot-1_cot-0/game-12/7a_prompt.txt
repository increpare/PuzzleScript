Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Pirate Plunge:** Navigate shifting seas and evade rival buccaneers to collect hidden treasure on a cursed archipelago..
