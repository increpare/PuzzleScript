To address the errors indicated in your PuzzleScript game and refine the game mechanics:

1. The rules for player movement when interacting with the Treasure need matching patterns on both sides of the rule.
2. Simplify and ensure that every rule specifies the same number of cells on both sides for each object type involved.

Here is the corrected version of your game code:

message Collect the treasure and avoid pirates!
```

### Explanation:

- Updated the player movement rules to correctly replace the "Treasure" with "Background" behind the player when collecting the treasure.
- Changed the wave rule conditions slightly to match fixed rules of movement.
- Simplified pirate movement rules, making sure pirates move only when adjacent to the player, but otherwise they are shifted to the left.
- Confirmed collisions to stop pirates at players are correctly specified.
- Ensured that game objects in the COLLISIONLAYERS are properly structured to prevent any unintended overlapping unless specified.

This should solve the errors while keeping the focus on collecting treasures and avoiding pirates in your game.
