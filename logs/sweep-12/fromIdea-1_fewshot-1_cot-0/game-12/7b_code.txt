### Notes
- The rules for pirate movement were modified to ensure both sides of the rules have the same number of cells, fulfilling the PuzzleScript requirement. Each side now has two pattern cells, including the necessary 'no Player' condition when no player blocks movement.
- This code maintains the core theme of navigating to collect treasure and avoiding pirates, adhering to your provided game idea.
