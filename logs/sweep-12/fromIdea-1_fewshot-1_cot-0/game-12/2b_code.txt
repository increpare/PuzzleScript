```
Changes made include:
- Added a `Wall` object to the game and updated the `LEGEND` to use `#` as a wall symbol, addressing lines 111-114 errors.
- Corrected the syntax for the `SOUNDS` section by listing each sound on a separate line as a numeric identifier.
- Modified the `WINCONDITIONS` from `all Treasure` to `no Treasure` to make winning achievable when all treasure is collected.
