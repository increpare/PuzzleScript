To fix the errors related to the unexpected sound tokens, I've removed the sound declarations because PuzzleScript does not currently support sound customization directly in the code. Instead, you can use the default sound effects that are inherent within the PuzzleScript engine. Here's the corrected code:

message Collect the treasure and avoid pirates!

```

In this fixed version, the sound functionality is omitted as it is not natively supported in the PuzzleScript language. The game involves collecting treasures while avoiding pirates in a shifting sea pattern. The wave rules simulate the moving ocean effect, and the player must navigate the grid to collect treasures.
