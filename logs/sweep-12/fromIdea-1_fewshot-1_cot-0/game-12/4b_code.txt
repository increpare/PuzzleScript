Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code for your game "Pirate Plunge." I've ensured that all required sections are present, added the missing "SOUNDS" section, and corrected the case sensitivity issues in the rule definitions.

Changes made:

1. Added a "SOUNDS" section to comply with the order requirement, even though it's empty.
2. Fixed the case sensitivity of "Player" and "Treasure" in rules to match the legend definitions.
3. Ensured all sections are present and correctly ordered according to PuzzleScript requirements.
