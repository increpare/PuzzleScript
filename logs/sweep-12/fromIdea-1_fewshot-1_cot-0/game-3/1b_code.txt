message Welcome to Time Trinkle! Flip tiles to synchronize time and solve the puzzle.

```

### Key Fixes:
- Adjusted the sprite definitions to ensure they match intended color palettes and have consistent structure.
- Fixed the rendering of the `Player` to avoid potential rendering errors.
- Each `Tile` object now uses a consistent single color drawn through `1/0` or `2/0` appropriately. This ensures compliance with their respective color palettes.

This should compile without the console errors and reflect your game's idea of time manipulation through tile-flipping puzzles.
