message Welcome to Time Trinkle! Flip tiles to synchronize time and solve the puzzle.
```

This game features the main mechanic of flipping time tiles to change their states and aligning the timeline with the Time Machine to win. The player can move around a grid and must flip all tiles in front of the Time Machine to their future state to restore history.
