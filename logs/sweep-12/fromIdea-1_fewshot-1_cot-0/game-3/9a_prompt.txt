Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Time Trinkle:** Manipulate time by flipping tiles forward or backward, solving paradox puzzles to restore history in a fractured world..
