### Changes Made:
1. **Errors in Legend/Objects**: 
   - Removed the comments that didn't adhere to syntax.
   - Ensured all elements in the level map are defined in the legend.

2. **Map Rectangularity**:
   - Made sure that all maps have consistent row lengths.

3. **Removed Extra Symbols**:
   - Removed the `#`, `L`, `V`, `1` marking error-causing characters from the descriptions and levels.
   - Replaced unnecessary characters to align with the defined terrain and objects.

This code should now compile correctly without errors and maintain a simple, strategic gameplay concept. Adjust gameplay elements further, if needed, to achieve desired game dynamics.
