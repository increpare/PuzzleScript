In this fixed version of the code:
- The sprite graphics for `Forest` and `Mountain` have been corrected to be 5x5.
- A player object has been defined correctly in the COLLISIONLAYERS.
- Addressed errors in the movement rules.
- Fixed the win condition to successfully evaluate when no `Enemy` objects are on the grid.
- Corrected symbols in the LEVELS section to reflect defined objects and ensure spacing issues do not produce errors.
- Assuming the player is represented by `P`, movement rules have been adjusted to ensure soldiers can move into empty spaces, implementing simplified logic to encourage strategic placement in a demake manner.
