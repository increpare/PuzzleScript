### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Level Row Alignment:** Ensured all rows in the levels have the same length.
2. **Adjusted Sprite Dimensions:** Adjusted `Forest` and `Mountain` sprite designs to ensure they're 5x5.
3. **Defined the `Player`:** Assigned the `Soldier` object as the `Player` for the game.
4. **Corrected Rule Syntax:** Used `[_ | > P]` syntax to ensure the pattern length matched in the `RULES` section.
