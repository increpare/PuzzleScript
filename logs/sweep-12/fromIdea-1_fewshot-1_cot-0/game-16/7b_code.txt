Changes made:
1. Fixed the rule `[ Player | Portal ] -> [ AlternateBackground Player ]` by ensuring the pattern on the right side has the same number of cells as the pattern on the left side. The use of `|` was replaced with a space to maintain dimension parity.
2. Retained the desired mechanics of toggling backgrounds upon entering a portal and checked for player interaction with an enemy.
