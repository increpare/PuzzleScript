Below is a repaired version of the PuzzleScript code. I've fixed the errors related to sounds by correcting the sound sections and ensuring that sound references in rules match with the defined sound names:

In this version, I've renamed the sound names to `portal_use`, `enemy_destroy`, and `wall_bump` to match their intents and corrected the rules to use these newly defined sound names. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to function as intended with sound feedback for actions.
