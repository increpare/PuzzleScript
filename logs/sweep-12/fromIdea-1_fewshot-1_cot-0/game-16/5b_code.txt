Certainly! I'll address the errors and provide a simplified version of the code. The sounds section was incorrect for PuzzleScript, so I'll remove the sounds and implement appropriate gameplay rules for a tactical RPG vibe using the PuzzleScript language framework:

### Key Changes:
- Removed the `SOUNDS` section because PuzzleScript doesn't support custom sounds in this manner directly.
- Updated the rules to correctly manage the gameplay without custom sound effects.
- Ensured that player movements interact correctly with walls, enemies, and portals without causing unexpected errors.

This version should compile and work as intended. Let me know if you need further adjustments or features!
