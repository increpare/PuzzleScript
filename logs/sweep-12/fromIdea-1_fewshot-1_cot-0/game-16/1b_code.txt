To address the errors in the original code, we need to ensure that the numbers used in the sprite color specifications match the number of colors defined in their respective palettes. Here is a corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
- Adjusted the `Player` sprite to only use two colors: black and white.
- Adjusted the `Enemy` sprite to use only one color: red.
- Corrected some sprite representations for consistency with the color limits. 
- Removed duplicate rule for Player-Enemy interaction in the rules section.

This should resolve the palette errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
