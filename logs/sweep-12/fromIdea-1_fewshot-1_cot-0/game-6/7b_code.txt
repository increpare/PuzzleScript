### Explanation of Corrections:

- **Wall Object:** Fixed the wall's color definition to use a 5x5 grid of colors, as `1` was used with a single color row only, which raised an error. 
- **Rule Syntax:** Corrected syntax issues in your rules. Specifically, each rule should be enclosed within brackets. 
- **Rule Meaning:** Adjusted some semantic errors within the rules for clarity, while maintaining the simplicity needed for a demake. Kept the rules simple yet meaningful as per demakes.
- **Error in Movement Rule:** Removed erroneous text in the comment within the rule to prevent parsing issues.

The rest of the code sections were in proper syntax, and this now represents a functional PuzzleScript game implementing the flip mechanics of Dungeon Dimensions!
