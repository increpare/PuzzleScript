In this repaired version of the code:
- The Wall object had its color palette corrected to consistently manage color indices.
- Sound tokens were corrected to the appropriate syntax.
- Rule tokens were adjusted appropriately with `action Player on Portal` for using the portal.
- The rules inside the square brackets are modified so objects appear only in valid positions according to PuzzleScript syntax.
