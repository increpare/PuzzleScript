### Key Fixes:
1. **Sprite Color Definitions:** Added more colors to the `Wall` sprite to remove the insufficient color error.
2. **Sound Definitions:** Corrected the sound definitions to follow the format `Soundverb SOUND` instead of using incorrect terms.
3. **Rule Syntax Error for Entry:** Ensured that objects (`Portal` in rule for portal interaction) exist within rules brackets, and corrected the rule for the portal action.

This should resolve the errors originally encountered and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
