### Changes Made:
1. **Wall Object Definition Fix**: Fixed the Wall object by using only one color due to palette limitations.
2. **Sound Definition Fix**: Updated `TELEPORT`, `PICKUP`, `ENEMYDEFEAT`, and `LEVELCOMPLETE` with placeholder sound codes `sfx0`, `sfx1`, `sfx2`, and `sfx3` respectively.
3. **Dimension Shift Action**: Used `action` keyword for the portal interaction as `action` now allows shift on interaction as intended.

Ensure you also tune the sound effects using those updated placeholders should you decide to play the game.
