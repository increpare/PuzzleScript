### Key Changes Made:

1. **Wall Colors Fixed:**
   - Reduced the color palette for Wall to a single line to fix out-of-bounds error messages.

2. **Square Bracket Rule Fixes:**
   - Corrected rule definitions by ensuring that conditions and transformations are within square brackets.

By addressing these errors, the game should now compile correctly, allowing you to trial the mechanics based on your design of switching dimensions and defeating enemies.
