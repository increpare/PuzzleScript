Here's the repaired version of your code that addresses the errors you encountered. I have made adjustments to the wall color palette, sound names, rule formats, and modified the win condition logic to ensure a functional game that aligns with your vision.

Key changes:
- Corrected the Wall sprite to have 5 colors by setting everything to "11111".
- Renamed sound tokens to be words like "Teleport", "Pickup", "EnemyDefeat", and "LevelComplete".
- Fixed syntax by enclosing Player and Portal inside square brackets for the portal action.
- Adjusted the win condition logic to require all Collectible items to be removed.
  
This fixes should resolve the compilation errors you encountered in the original code.
