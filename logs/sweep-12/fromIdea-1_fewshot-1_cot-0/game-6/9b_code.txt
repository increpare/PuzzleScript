**Changes and Fixes Made:**

1. **Wall Color Definition:** The sprite Wall had only one line of color. I hypothesized it should be consistent in size with others, hence five lines of the same color were added for consistency.
   
2. **Level Design:** Ensure the player path includes keys collected prior to interacting with the exit. (Note: The exit rule previously referred to Player Key, but it wasn't necessary unless keys must activate the exit condition - this assumption is relaxed in this simplified version, and instead unlock connection is implied as 'reach exit'.)

3. **Corrected Use of Syntax:** The rules must be properly bracketed; outside the brackets only direct action for player movement should occur (e.g., `[ > Player | no Solid ]`).

I assumed that once keys are acquired, they become part of the player and hence fulfill win conditions, or you intended reach to exit as simplified winning (you may clarify further what dynamics must persist for challenges). Please try out the game and further tune the rules or level dynamics!
