**Explanation of Changes:**
- Corrected the rule `[ > Player | Spell ] -> [ Player Spell ]` to `[ > Player | Spell ] -> [ > Player | > Spell ]` so both inputs match in length.
- Corrected the rule `[ > Player | Crop ] -> [ Player | Farm ]` to `[ > Player | Crop ] -> [ > Player | Farm ]` so both inputs match in length.
- Adapted `[ > Enemy | . ] -> [ > Enemy ]` to ensure movement for enemies and aligned with coding rules.
- Removed unnecessary decorator notations to better fit the simplified game design.
