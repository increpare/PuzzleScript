Here is a repaired version of the PuzzleScript code for the game "Crops & Castles". I've corrected the errors related to sound verbs and pattern mismatches in the rules.

In the repaired code:
- I have changed the incorrect sound verb `HARVEST` to `MOVE` for the Crop object.
- I have addressed the missing sound verb for creating spells by changing it to `MOVE`.
- I ensured that the rules have matching patterns on both sides by correcting the single or missing pattern presence.
