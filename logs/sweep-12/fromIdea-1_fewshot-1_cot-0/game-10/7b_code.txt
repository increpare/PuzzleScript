### Key Changes:
- **Rule Adjustments**: The rules `[ > Player | Crop ] -> [ > Player | Farm ]` and `[ > Player | Spell ] -> [ > Player ]` were adjusted to ensure that both the left and right sides of each pattern have the same number of cells. Specifically, the Player retains its position after interacting with a Crop or Spell.
- **Win Condition and Rules**: Ensure win condition and game logic follow the intended narrative: strategically interacting with Crops and defending against Enemies to achieve victory once all Enemies are defeated.
