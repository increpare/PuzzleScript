Explanation of Changes:

1. Updated sound effects with valid verbs such as "MOVE", "Create", and "Win".
2. Eliminated the "#" lacking definitions by assigning '#' to 'Castle' in the legend.
3. Simplified the rules to align with this new set-up, focusing on core interactions such as collecting crops, encountering enemies, and winning conditions.
