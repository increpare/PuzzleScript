### Changes Made:
- Corrected the error by ensuring both sides of the rules are of equal length (e.g., `[ > Player | Spell ] -> [ > Player | Farm ]`).
- Simplified some rules, specifically for interacting with Spells and Enemies, while still maintaining the core mechanics of harvesting crops to power up the kingdom.
