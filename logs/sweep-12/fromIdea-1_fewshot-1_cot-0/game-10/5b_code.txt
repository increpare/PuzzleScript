Changes made:
1. Changed the sound verb `"LevelComplete"` to `"Player"` in the `SOUNDS` section, as `LevelComplete` is not a valid sound verb.
2. Changed the rule `[ > Player | Enemy ] -> RESTART` to `[ > Player | Enemy ] -> [ Player ] SFX4`, ensuring it matches the pattern length and triggers the custom restart sound.
3. Removed an unnecessary space and added `SFX2` to the enemy movement rule for sound feedback.
