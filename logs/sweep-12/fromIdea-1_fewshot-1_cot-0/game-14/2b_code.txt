Certainly, here's a revised version of the code that addresses the given errors and presents the basic idea of constructing a train track through challenging landscapes to connect towns:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Object Naming Adjustments**: 
   - Replaced the legend symbols for `Mountain` and `Track` by `M` and `|` respectively to avoid using reserved keywords as object names.
2. **TrainTrack Color Issue**: 
   - Adjusted the design of `TrainTrack` to use valid defined colors and corrected the index.
3. **Switch Logic**: 
   - Simplified the interaction logic with switches, assuming switches might affect how tracks are interacted with. No full track direction reversal logic since such mechanics would require a more complex implementation outside of the current game context.
4. **Collision Layers**: 
   - Ensured that `Background` is its own layer, distinct from other object layers.
5. **Rules Adjustments**: 
   - Simplified the rule for switches due to inherently more complex mechanics in the original vision that might exceed the beginner-friendly state of PuzzleScript.
