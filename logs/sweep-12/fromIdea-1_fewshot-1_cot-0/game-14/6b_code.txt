### Changes Made:

1. **Sound Definitions**: Removed the erroneous capitalization of sound names in the RULES section:
   - Changed `TrainMove` to `trainmove` in rules to match the case-sensitive sound identifier.
   - Changed `SwitchSound` to `switchsound` in rules to match the case-sensitive sound identifier.

2. **Key Not Found Errors**: In the LEVELS section, corrected layout errors:
   - Replaced `T` with `Tw` as defined in the legend.
   - Removed invalid character `#` that was present without a definition, thus simplified the level.

These adjustments ensure the game code aligns with the structure defined and removes any inconsistencies causing compilation errors.
