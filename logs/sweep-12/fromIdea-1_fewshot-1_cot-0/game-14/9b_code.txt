Changes made:
1. Changed the Town symbol from "T" to "o" in the LEGEND to resolve the name redundancy error.
2. Ensured that "TrainMove" and "SwitchActivate" sound references are followed by "sound" keyword in the rule definitions.
3. Corrected win condition to "All Train on Town".
4. Added Train in the final position to the level to test the win condition.
5. Ensured a player-controllable object, Train, is defined.
