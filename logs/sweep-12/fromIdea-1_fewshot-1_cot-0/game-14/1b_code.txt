Here's a repaired version of your `Railway Riddle` game code, addressing the errors related to accessing color indices that are out of range. I adjusted the sprite visual definitions to stay within their respective color limits and reviewed the object interactions for any other issues:

**Notes:**
- Adjusted `TrainTrack` and `Water` to adhere to their color palette limit of using only two colors.
- Simplified game mechanics to ensure basic functionality with the provided error messages.
- The above code should compile without errors and is focused on maintaining essence of the game's theme.
