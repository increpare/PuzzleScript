**Explanation:**

- Changed the object name for the train `|` to `Track` and updated `[ > Train | Track ]` to `[ > Tr | | ]` in the rules to avoid using the character `|` as an object name.
- Corrected the sound syntax to match existing conventions by renaming `TrainMove` to `Train` and referenced this sound in the rules.
- Included `TrainTrack` and simplified the win condition to focus on trains being on tracks.
- Corrected the syntax for actions involving switches in the rule section, matching object names properly and simplifying the observation of switch sounds.
