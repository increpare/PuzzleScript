### Explanation of Changes:
1. Updated the color palette for the `Wall` object to ensure it only uses defined colors (replaced `22222` with `11111`).
2. Removed the third color from `Treasure` since only two colors can be defined per object.
3. Added `DarkBrown` as the second color for the `Door` to match the requirement for two colors.
4. The rest of the code adheres to standard PuzzleScript game logic and features. 

With these changes, the game should compile without errors and be playable.
