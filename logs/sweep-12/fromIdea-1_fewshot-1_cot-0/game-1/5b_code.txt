### Key Changes Made:
1. **Color Index Management:** 
    - Corrected the key's color indexing by ensuring it uses only one defined color (line 44 error). The key's pattern was adjusted to use the available color.
    - Ensured the player object only references two valid colors (line 60 error).

2. **Sound Commands Syntax:** 
    - Applied the correct sound trigger syntax (e.g. SFX1, SFX2, SFX3) to get rid of errors (lines 82, 83, 84) as the names used previously were incorrect.
   
3. **Rule and Sound Tag Linking:**
    - Linked the rules with their respective sound effects using SFX indices.

4. **Removed Invalid Sound Tag:**
    - Removed invalid `sound` token calls and replaced them with correct syntax (line 99 error).
   
### Game Synopsis:
This game requires the player to collect treasures and keys while avoiding traps. Each key can unlock doors to proceed further. The objective is to collect all treasures to win the levels.
