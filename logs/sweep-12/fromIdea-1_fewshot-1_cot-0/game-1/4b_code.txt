Here's the revised version of the PuzzleScript game code for "Puzzlot." The errors have been addressed by ensuring the correct number of colors are defined in the palettes for the 'Key' and 'Door' objects. I've also simplified the gameplay to better fit the PuzzleScript environment:

In this code:
- The 'Key' and 'Door' definitions have been fixed by removing extra colors that were not used, aligning with the console error messages.
- The basic rules for moving, picking up treasures and keys, unlocking doors, and triggering traps are maintained. 
- The game levels provide simple logic puzzles using these mechanics.
