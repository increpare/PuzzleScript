Below is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I fixed the color palette index issues by adjusting the colors to ensure all sprites have the proper number of colors defined based on their usage. Additionally, I've adjusted the logic for unlocking doors so that it only works if the player has collected a key.

This version should now compile without error. The door logic requires the player to have picked up a key to move through a door.
