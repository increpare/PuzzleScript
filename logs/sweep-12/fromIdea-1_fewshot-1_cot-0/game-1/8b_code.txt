Changes made:
1. Corrected the sound syntax in the `SOUNDS` section by specifying the `Player` interaction that triggers the sound.
2. Updated the `RULES` section to ensure that the Player must have a Key to unlock a Door (`[ Player Key | Door ] -> [ Player ]`).
3. Ensured each level's layout is enclosed in walls to prevent errors related to undefined objects (also added a wall to the boundaries of each level).

This should address the errors noted in the console output, allowing the game to compile and run correctly.
