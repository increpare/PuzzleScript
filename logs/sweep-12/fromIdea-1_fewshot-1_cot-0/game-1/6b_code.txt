Here's a repaired version of the code that addresses the errors reported. I've fixed the color palette issues, corrected the sounds, and ensured all symbols are defined in the legend.

Key changes include adjusting the color definitions for the `Key`, `Door`, and `Player` objects to have at least 2 colors in their palettes, fixing the sound verbs to be one of the expected terms (MOVE, RESTART, UNDO), and ensuring all referenced items in the levels are defined in the `LEGEND`.
