### Explanation
- **Error Fixes**: Addressed the syntax issues related to sound verbs by replacing influenced rules with the appropriate sound commands right after actions like 'PickupTreasure', 'PickupKey', etc.
- **Game Simplification**: Simplified interactions and prevented undefined or extra elements from causing issues.
- **Sound Effects**: Added basic sound effect labels for the rules, ensuring to use them properly as game interactions (e.g., picking up items, unlocking doors, hitting traps).

Feel free to test it out in a PuzzleScript environment, where you can play the simple game of gathering treasures while avoiding traps and unlocking doors.
