The task involves fixing the errors present in the provided PuzzleScript game code. Let's address the issues one by one:

1. **Palette Error in Portal Sprite**: The error occurs because there's a reference to a second color (`.0..`) in the `Portal` sprite, but the sprite's color definition in the `Portal` object hasn't been set up for multiple colors. We'll ensure the palette definition is consistent with the sprite.

2. **Rectangular Maps**: The levels must be rectangular, meaning that each row in a map must be of equal length. We'll ensure that each level is rectangular by adjusting the rows so each has an equal number of characters.

3. **Demake Concept**: We'll summarize the game's concept: navigating through dimensions and using portals strategically to solve puzzles and avoid enemies. We'll ensure these remain intact through appropriate game rules and win conditions.

Let's fix these issues and simplify the code to match the demake style.

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Sprite Colors**: Added `white` to the `Portal` object color palette to align with the sprite's design.
- **Rectangular Levels**:
  - Added spaces to ensure all rows in each level are of equal length (10 characters).
- **Descriptive Messages**:
  - Ensured the level messages provide hints on the objective and the usage of game mechanics, i.e., using portals to swap dimensions. 

This code should now run correctly as a simple "demake" of the Dungeon Dimensions concept, maintaining core mechanics in a PuzzleScript format.
