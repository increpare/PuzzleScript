too many errors, aborting compilation
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Dungeon Dimensions:** Flip between alternate dimensions using magical portals to solve spatial puzzles and defeat enemies in this tactical RPG..
