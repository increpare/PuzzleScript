To address the issues:

1. **Color Definition**: The `Portal` object has two colors (line 32) defined but only one is properly utilized in the sprite matrix. We need two more color definitions for `Portal`, in line with the sprite attribute format, which requires four colors.

2. **Rectangular Maps**: The level map on line 125 has non-uniform row lengths due to missing characters. Ensure the levels are rectangular by adding spaces or additional characters as needed to maintain consistency in row lengths.

Here is the corrected game code, which maintains the theme of a tactical RPG where players navigate through dimensions and avoid enemies:

**Explanation of Changes**:
- **Portal Color Definition**: Ensured that the `Portal` object has the correct number of color definitions for its sprite matrix visualization.
- **Rectangular Level Design**: Both levels are now properly rectangular with consistent row lengths, adding necessary `#` to ensure that all lines are equal in length.
