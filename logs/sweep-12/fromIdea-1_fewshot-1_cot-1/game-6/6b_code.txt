To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we'll start by analyzing the errors. The main problem is the improper use of comments within the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript doesn't support inline comments using `//` like many other programming languages. Comments in PuzzleScript can be placed outside the object definitions, rules, and other sections by using plain text preceded by `#`.

Additionally, let's review the game to ensure it correctly implements the concept of switching dimensions using portals and defeating enemies as described in the game idea. We need to make sure the logic for switching dimensions is properly implemented.

Let's go step by step and correct the provided code:

1. Remove invalid inline comments.
2. Ensure dimension-switching logic with the portal is correctly handled.
3. Make sure the game ends when there are no enemies left as per the winning condition `no Enemy`.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

In this corrected version, we:

- Removed the invalid `//` comment styles.
- Ensured that transitioning between dimensions using portals is possible and correctly implemented by switching the dimension of the portal upon contact with the player.
- Ensured that the player can defeat enemies by simply overlapping them, fulfilling the win condition when there are no enemies left.
