To create a complete PuzzleScript game that represents a demake of "Dungeon Dimensions," we'll follow these steps:

1. **Game Concept Simplification:**
   - Players can switch between two dungeon dimensions. 
   - Players move strategically on a grid to defeat enemies and avoid obstacles.
   - Use portals to switch dimensions.
   - Objective is to clear the dungeon by defeating all enemies.

2. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Use a grid-based movement system that allows players to move up, down, left, and right.
   - Define two dimensions with different layouts.
   - Use a simple attack mechanism to defeat enemies.
   - Portals are placed on the level to switch between dimensions.

3. **Design Elements:**
   - Player (`P`): Moves around and interacts with the game elements.
   - Wall (`#`): Impassable obstacles.
   - Portal (`O`): Allows the player to switch between dimensions.
   - Enemy (`E`): Occupies grid cells and can be defeated.
   - Empty cells (`.`): Movable space.

4. **Win Condition:**
   - The game is won when all enemies in both dimensions are defeated.

5. **PuzzleScript Implementation:**
   - Implement objects, rules, and levels necessary to illustrate the gameplay mechanics.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript implementation:

### Explanation:

- **Objects and Elements:**
  - Player, Wall, Enemy, Portal, and Background are the key objects.
  - Dimension tiles (`1` for Dimension1 and `2` for Dimension2) illustrate the two alternate dimensions.

- **Rules:**
  - The player can move around the grid.
  - Interacting with a portal switches between dimensions.
  - Players can defeat enemies by simply moving into the same tile.

- **Levels:**
  - A sample level is provided showing both dimensions with respective portals, obstacles, and enemies.

This code reflects a simplified "Dungeon Dimensions" game where players use portals strategically to navigate through space, switch dimensions, and defeat enemies.
