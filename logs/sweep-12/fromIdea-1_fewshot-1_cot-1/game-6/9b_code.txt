To address the errors reported during the compilation of the PuzzleScript game, I'll take the following steps:

1. **Review and Correct the Rule Syntax**: The errors suggest issues with the comments in the rules, as these comments are interpreted as code. I'll correct these by either moving them out of the `RULES` section or removing them altogether.

2. **Verify Object and Rule Syntax**: Check that all objects are properly defined and used in square brackets within rules.

3. **Understand Game Logic**: The game requires a mechanism to switch between dimensions using portals. This involves ensuring that the player can interact with portals to switch dimensions correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

**Explanation:**

- **Comments**: I have removed the comments located directly within the `RULES` section as they seem to be causing misinterpretation issues. PuzzleScript does not allow text outside of brackets, leading to the errors.

- **Player Movement**: Kept the rule for moving the player when there's no obstruction (no Wall).

- **Dimension Switching**: Updated rules for switching dimensions using the portal object. When a player interacts with a portal, it switches between active and inactive dimensions.

- **Enemy Interaction**: Added a basic player interaction rule with Enemy, where the player can defeat the enemy by moving onto the same space.

By doing these corrections, the game should now compile and run as intended, allowing the player to switch dimensions using portals and defeat enemies.
