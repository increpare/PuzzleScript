To resolve the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the errors related to the rule syntax and object names. Here are the steps we will take:

1. **Correct Rule Syntax**: PuzzleScript requires that objects must be inside square brackets `[ ]` in the rules section. The syntax should follow `[condition] -> [result]`, with specific directions allowed outside brackets (e.g., `right`, `left`, `up`, `down`).

2. **Address Misnamed Objects and Terms**: Ensure that all object names and terms used in the rules match the defined legends and are valid in context. 

3. **Implement Dimension Switching**: Use conditions for the player and portal to switch dimensions accurately.

4. **Simplify the Game to Match a Demake**: The game should focus on flipping between dimensions to solve puzzles and eliminate enemies.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

### Explanation:

- **Fixed Rule Syntax**: Adjusted the rule syntax to fit within the correct structure of `[condition] -> [result]`.
- **Dimension Switching**: Clarified how portals toggle dimensions using `Dimension1` and `Dimension2`.
- **Collision Logic**: Ensured simple collision logic for movement and attacking, matching the simplicity intended for a demake.
- **Level Structure**: Maintained the level separation to guide players through dimension-specific puzzles and enemy challenges.
