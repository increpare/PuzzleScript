To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following issues:

1. The comments in the rules section starting with `#` are causing errors because PuzzleScript recognizes `#` as a line comment marker, not an indicator for section headers like "Player moves". Instead of placing the comment text after the `#` symbol, place any explanatory comments after the `//` to denote inline comments.

2. The rules for dimension switching and player movement are incorrectly defined. Specifically, the rule syntax requires conditions and consequences in block format, which means they should not include any text outside of rules.

3. Ensure that there's consistency in element names as conflict or incorrect names might result in unresolved references.

4. The conditions for dimension switching currently involve checking for the absence or presence of Dimension1 or Dimension2. The intended behavior should be toggling the state, but a single flag (either active or not active) would suffice for a simple version of switching.

5. The collision layers should not include portal logic directly; rather, make sure that the object structure doesn't create an unintended interaction hierarchy. 

By addressing these issues, the code below should compile without errors, and reflect the intended mechanics of switching dimensions and fighting enemies:

**Key Adjustments:**

- We have two objects: `ActiveDimension` and `InactiveDimension`. They are Black and White to indicate active or not active.
- The dimension-switching rules have been simplified to toggle between these two objects when the player steps on a portal.
- Avoided conflicts with object names and legend definitions.
- Comments are adjusted to not conflict with PuzzleScript syntax.
