To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code:

1. **Sprite Size Error**: The sprite graphics need to be exactly 5x5 pixels. The original Pirate sprite is 5x5, but the Treasure sprite is not. We need to adjust the Treasure sprite to be exactly 5x5 pixels.

2. **Rule Pattern Length Error**: In the rule at line 80, both sides of the rule need to have matching pattern lengths. We need to ensure the pattern on the right is of the same number of objects over the same span as the pattern on the left.

The central idea of the game is to navigate around while avoiding pirates and collecting treasure. Let's ensure that all sprite graphics are 5x5, and rules are correctly defined.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the Treasure sprite to be 5x5.
2. Fixed the pattern length mismatch in the "Restart if caught by a pirate" rule to ensure both sides are equal.
