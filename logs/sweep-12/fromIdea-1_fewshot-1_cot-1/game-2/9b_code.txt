To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, I need to address two major issues:

1. **Sprite Graphics Size**: The sprite graphics must be exactly 5x5 in size. The `Pirate` sprite has the correct 5x5 dimensions, but both the `Player` and `Treasure` sprites need adjustment to fit the standard 5x5 grid.

2. **Rule Pattern Length**: In the ruleset, both sides of a rule should have matching lengths in terms of the number of cells. I will ensure that the number of columns in patterns on the left side of the rules matches the number on the right.

Let's implement the plan to fix these issues:

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation:

- **Sprite Graphics Adjustment**: The `Player` sprite's dimensions have been corrected to be 5x5 by ensuring the last row is filled correctly to occupy the space. The `Treasure` sprite was already 5x5.

- **Rule Pattern Length**: The rule `[ P | T ] -> [ P | . ]` now correctly matches the length of the left-side pattern to the right-side pattern. The terrain (`.`) is intentionally marked as `Background` on the right side to denote cleared treasure.

This revised version fixes the identified bugs and enhances the playability of the demake by maintaining its intended challenge of navigating islands, avoiding pirates, and collecting treasure.
