To address the errors, we need to review and correct several issues in the game code:

1. **Legend Symbols:** The error messages indicate that the key "O" is not defined. It seems like "O" was intended to represent Treasure points in levels 2 and 3. Additionally, there are errors with the symbol " ", which should be addressed.

2. **Sprite Dimensions:** The sprite for "Treasure" is not correctly defined as 5x5 pixels. We'll need to adjust it.

3. **Rectangular Levels:** The levels must be rectangular, meaning all rows should have the same length.

4. **Map Symbol Usage:** Ensure that all symbols used in the level definitions are declared in the legend.

Let's fix these issues with adjustments to the code:

### Explanation of Fixes:
- **Legend & Symbols:** Ensured the correct symbols are used and defined for each object. Removed the undefined "O" symbol and replaced it with the defined "T" for Treasure.
- **Sprite Dimensions:** Validated that all objects have proper 5x5 sprite definitions.
- **Rectangular Levels:** Adjusted the levels to be properly rectangular, ensuring all rows within a level have the same length.
- **Consistent Map Usage:** Used symbols consistently across maps and ensured they are defined in the legend. 

With these fixes, the code should compile without errors, allowing players to navigate the levels, collect treasures, and avoid pirates, capturing the spirit of a simplified "Pirate Plunge" game.
