To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that each object's color pattern aligns with its defined color palette. The console output indicates that there are references to nonexistent colors in the `TREASURE` and `ISLAND` objects. Hereâ€™s the plan to fix these issues:

1. **Update Color Definitions:**
   - Ensure each object only uses colors available in its palette.

2. **Correct Object Patterns:**
   - Adjust the patterns of `TREASURE` and `ISLAND` so that they only use the defined colors.

With these steps in mind, let's correct the game code:

### Explanations:
- **Treasure Object:** I added `black` to the palette to correctly map the given pattern numbers `0` to `FFD700` and `black`.
- **Island Object:** The color pattern was simplified to use the single defined `green` color.

This should address the errors, ensuring the object patterns align with their available color palettes. Now the game should compile correctly without console errors, providing a basic `demake` of the "Navigate shifting seas and evade rival buccaneers to collect hidden treasure on a cursed archipelago" theme.
