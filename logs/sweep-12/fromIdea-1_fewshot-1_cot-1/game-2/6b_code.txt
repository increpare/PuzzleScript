To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Maps must be rectangular:** In each level, ensure that all rows are of the same length.
2. **Sprite graphics size:** Each sprite must be exactly 5x5 pixels.
3. **Movement in late rules:** Movements cannot appear in late rules.
4. **Incorrect pattern lengths in rules:** Ensure that the patterns on the left and right sides of the rules are of equal length.

Considering these issues, here are the steps to fix the code:

- Make sure all sprite graphics adhere to the 5x5 pixel requirement.
- Rectify the level maps so that each level is a rectangle (i.e., all rows should be of equal length).
- Remove the movement from the late rule or adjust it appropriately to the standard rules.
- Check each rule to ensure the patterns on both sides are of equal length.

Here's the revised code:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Sprites Sizes:** Adjusted the `Pirate` and `Treasure` sprites to ensure they are 5x5 pixels.
2. **Rectangular Level Maps:** Modified the levels to make sure all rows are the same length.
3. **Late Rule Fix:** Removed movement from the late rule and placed it accordingly under the standard rules. The rule for preventing movement off islands was adjusted to fit standard rule constraints.
4. **Balanced Rule Patterns:** Ensured all rule patterns have corresponding matches on either side of the rule statement. This prevents any syntax errors related to mismatched pattern lengths.
