To create a simplified demake of "Pirate Plunge" in PuzzleScript, we need to focus on capturing the core elements of navigating seas, evading pirates, and collecting treasures. We'll design a simple game with the following components:

1. **Objects**:
   - **Background**: Represents the sea.
   - **Player**: The pirate ship.
   - **Pirate**: Rival pirate ships to evade.
   - **Treasure**: The objective to collect.
   - **Island**: Cursed land or obstacles.

2. **Rules**:
   - The player can move in four directions.
   - Pirates move in set patterns to simulate patrolling.
   - Collecting a treasure removes it from the game.
   - If the player and pirate collide, it's game over.
   - Winning condition is collecting all treasures.

3. **Levels**:
   - Levels will consist of islands that form obstacles, treasures to collect, and pirates that the player needs to evade.

Below is the complete PuzzleScript code for a simple demake of "Pirate Plunge":

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: We created objects for the player (pirate ship), rival pirates, treasures, islands, and the background sea.
- **Rules**: Defined rules for player movement, pirate patrol, treasure collection, and collision with pirates for game over.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensured the correct interaction between layers.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all treasures are collected.
- **Levels**: Introduced simple levels to showcase basic navigation and evasion mechanics. 

This code organizes the basic mechanics for navigating, evading, and collecting in a simplified PuzzleScript game.
