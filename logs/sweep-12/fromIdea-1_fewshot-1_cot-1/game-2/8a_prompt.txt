line 35 : Sprite graphics must be 5 wide and 5 high exactly.
line 80 : In a rule, each pattern to match on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length (number of cells).
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Pirate Plunge:** Navigate shifting seas and evade rival buccaneers to collect hidden treasure on a cursed archipelago.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
