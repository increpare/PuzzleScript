To resolve the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address several issues:

1. **Maps must be rectangular**: Each level in the code must have rows of the same length. Therefore, we need to adjust the rows in each level to make sure they are of equal length.

2. **Sprite size constraint**: Each sprite graphic must be exactly 5x5 pixels. The "Treasure" sprite appears to be less than 5x5. We'll need to update it to fit this requirement.

3. **Rule pattern length**: In the rules, each pattern on the left must match each corresponding pattern on the right in terms of cell count. We'll need to ensure that both sides of the rules are symmetrical.

Let's address these points in the code:

**Key Modifications:**
- Adjusted the "Treasure" object to ensure it's a 5x5 sprite by moving one of the pixels in the third row.
- Ensured all level rows are of the same length by appending periods to the shorter rows.
- Corrected the rule for when the pirate catches the player to make sure both sides of the rule match in length. Previously it was written as `restart` which might implicitly imply length mismatch upon rule isolation. 

These fixes are meant to address the errors and fulfill the game's requirements as a simplified interpretation of the "Pirate Plunge" concept.
