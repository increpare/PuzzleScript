Changes made:
- We've updated level 3 to ensure it's solvable: moved the Pirate to a different position so it's not immediately blocking the Player from the Treasure.
- Updated the Pirate's movement rule to give the pirate more freedom to move around, except on the islands.
- Adjusted the Player's movement rule to prevent it from moving into an island space, facilitating more accurate gameplay for a demake of "Pirate Plunge".
