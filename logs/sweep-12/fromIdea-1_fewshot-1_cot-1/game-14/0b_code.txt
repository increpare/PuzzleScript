To create a demake of the game "Railway Riddle" in the PuzzleScript language, I will need to design a simplified version of the original game concept. Here are the key elements to consider:

1. **Game Objective:** The player constructs a train track to connect towns. The objective is to complete a continuous track path from the start to the end.

2. **Objects:** 
   - Background (Grass)
   - Track Pieces: Straight Track, Corner Track
   - Player (Current Track)
   - Start and End Points (Towns)

3. **Rules:** 
   - The player can place track pieces (straight or corner) to extend the track from start to end.
   - Track pieces must connect seamlessly to form a continuous track.
   - The game is won when the track connects the start and end points.

4. **Levels:** Design levels to challenge the player in constructing the track through different setups.

5. **Collision Layers:** Define how objects interact to facilitate placing tracks and checking connections.

Now, I will write the complete code for this demake in PuzzleScript:

### Explanation:
- **Game Mechanics:** The player must place track pieces to form a continuous line from the 'Start' to the 'End' point. The player alters the position of the 'CurrentTrack' to lay down tracks.
- **Levels:** The example level is straightforward to introduce the rule set. Additional levels can be added by expanding the complexity and introducing obstacles.
- **Win Conditions:** Ensure that both the start and end points are part of the completed track.

This demake keeps the core aspects of the puzzle genre while simplifying the mechanics for the PuzzleScript platform.
