Let's address the issues and adjust the game code for correctness:

1. **Name Errors in Rules:**
   - The `=` symbol is used in rules, but it's not defined in the legend. It should refer to `Background`.
   - Ensure that `StraightTrack` and `CornerTrack` use the appropriate symbols in the rules.

2. **Clear CurrentTrack Rule:**
   - This appears to attempt a cleanup action, but it's improperly formatted. We should define a rule to clear `CurrentTrack` effectively after it has fulfilled its purpose, such as placing a finalized `StraightTrack` or `CornerTrack`.

3. **Console Message Mistake:**
   - The console output messages indicate formatting issues. Ensure there are no leftover characters or misplaced syntax in the levels.

4. **Level Design:**
   - Ensure that the starting and ending points are correctly positioned, allowing for player interaction to place tracks connecting them.

Here's a revised version of the code following these observations:

```

### Key Adjustments:

- Replaced references to `=` in `[> CurrentTrack | =]` with `Background` in rules.
- Ensured clearing of `CurrentTrack` is performed correctly using a late rule.
- Level layout is reviewed to allow practical track placement by ensuring start and end are reachable for track construction.

This should result in a functional basic game that covers constructing a track connection between start and end points using dynamic placement of `StraightTrack` and `CornerTrack`.
