To address the errors in the code and ensure the game runs correctly, let's break down the necessary changes:

1. **Legend Mapping**: Add definitions for the "#" and "=" symbols within the `LEGEND` section of the code, as they currently cause errors due to being undefined.

2. **Rectangular Maps**: Ensure that each level map has rows of the same length to meet the requirements for rectangular maps.

3. **Remove Unnecessary Characters**: The "$" character in the second level is undefined, so either define it or remove it.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

### Changes Made:
- **Defined `#` and `=`**: Added `Wall` and `Path` objects and mapped them to `#` and `=` respectively in the legend.
- **Rectified Level Design**: Fixed level maps to ensure each row is of consistent length.
- **Removed `$`**: Removed the "End" and the undefined character "$" from the second level, ensuring consistent width.

This should address all compilation errors and maintain the simplicity of creating a track from start to end.
