To repair the code, I will address the errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Line 60:** This error is caused by having invalid content after the equals signs. I will ensure only comments follow the equals signs where necessary.
   
2. **Line 83-84:** The rules for placing track pieces reference non-existent names or objects. I will correct the names and ensure all objects and tags are defined properly.

Let's refine the code with these points addressed:

### Key Changes and Fixes:
- Adjusted the format of the comments; used the correct `;` for in-line comments and ensured correct use of the rule syntax.
- Declared all necessary object patterns in the `LEGEND` section for symbols being used.
- Fixed incorrect references in the rules by ensuring that names referenced in rules exist.
- Provided a sequential rule for placing tracks with a simple left-to-right reading order.

The game should now correctly interpret games rules for connecting the tracks from `Start` to `End` using `StraightTrack` and contextual use of `CornerTrack` with the defined logic.
