To address the reported errors and improve the game's functionality, let's break down the necessary modifications:

1. **Legend Errors:** The console error on line 60 tells us that comments should only follow a line with equals signs. This simplifies to understanding that `=` is being misinterpreted as a symbol or object. Let's adjust the legend symbols to more recognizable characters.

2. **Sound Error:** Trying to specify "none" for sounds seems incorrect according to the error report. To resolve this, we should remove the sounds section entirely since it is unnecessary. 

3. **Rule Syntax Error:** The rule involving `;` and "clear" is syntactically incorrect. We should instead utilize late rules to achieve the desired outcome (clearing the track).

4. **Gameplay Objective:** Ensure the objective reflects the intent of constructing a railway from start to end.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

**Summary of Changes:**
- Adjusted legend symbols for clarity.
- Removed the "none" sound definition as the game currently does not need sound.
- Corrected the rule that attempted to immediately clear tracks after setting them to a dedicated late rule.
- Maintained the gameplay premise of connecting tracks from start to end using simple digital symbols for visual clarity and reduced complexity.
