From the console output, it appears that the issue arises from the sprite color definitions for several objects. The error messages indicate that the color index specified in the sprite design exceeds the number of colors provided. Specifically, each object should have enough colors in its color list to account for references made in their sprite designs.

Here's the plan to fix the errors:
1. **Ensure Correct Color Assignment**:
   - For the `Start` object, the sprite references colors indexed as `0` and `1`, but only one color (BLUE) is defined. Additional color assignments are required.
   - The same issue occurs with `End`, `StraightTrack`, and `CornerTrack` objects.
2. **Adjust the Color Definitions**:
   - Each object will have a few default colors assigned, ensuring the number of colors matches the highest index used in its sprite.

I'll modify the objects' color specifications to resolve these issues. Here's the corrected version of the game code:

**Changes Made:**
- Added a second color (DARKBLUE and DARKRED) to `Start` and `End` respectively, to match indices 0 and 1 in the sprite.
- Added a second color (GREY) to `StraightTrack` and `CornerTrack` where the color index used was `1`.
  
This code should compile without errors now, allowing players to create a railroad track to connect between start and end points.
