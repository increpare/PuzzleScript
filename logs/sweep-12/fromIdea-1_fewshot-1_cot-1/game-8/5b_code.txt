The console errors are due to comments within the rules section. In PuzzleScript, comments must be placed in the `title`, `author`, `homepage`, or `message` sections, but not within the `RULES` section. The comments were misinterpreted as rule content, leading to compilation errors.

Here's the corrected game code:

I removed the comments from the rules and fixed their placement. The game should now compile without errors and function as intended. The goal is to collect olives, combine them in cauldrons, and bring the resulting "dishes" to exits to progress through levels.
