To fix the errors in the original code, we need to focus on the following aspects:

1. **Remove comments within rules**: PuzzleScript doesn't support inline comments within the rules section. We'll need to remove these comments to avoid errors.

2. **Check collisions and rule syntax**: Ensure that rules accurately describe interactions and movements without syntax errors.

3. **Adjust the win conditions**: Ensure that the win conditions are phrased correctly and match what we expect from the game concept.

4. **Simplify mechanics for a demake**: The core concept involves collecting olives and using cauldrons, with the intent of reaching an exit. We must translate these ideas into valid PuzzleScript mechanics.

Let's implement these fixes and adjustments:

Key changes and reasoning:

- **Removed inline comments in rules**: Comments within the rules section were causing parsing issues. Removing or relocating them to the correct place avoided these errors while keeping clarity.
  
- **Ensured rule syntax correctness**: Verified that the rules are properly formatted to describe intended behaviors. This includes ensuring that all entities are correctly referred to using their legend identifiers.

- **Simplified mechanics**: The primary aim is to collect olives by moving them into cauldrons and meeting the exit condition. The mechanics facilitate olive pushing by the player and conditionally collecting olives into cauldrons.

- **Win Condition**: The aim is to have cauldrons placed on exits. This mechanizes the transformation and completion process intended by the concept.

This code should now compile in PuzzleScript and represent a simple rendition of the Olive Odyssey game concept.
