To repair the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address several issues:

1. Comments in PuzzleScript should be placed in the correct location to avoid confusion. The errors indicate that the comment lines were being interpreted as part of rules, leading to unrecognized names.
2. Simplify the rules by ensuring they match the available game mechanics provided in PuzzleScript.

The task involves allowing the player to push "Olive" objects into a "Cauldron" and then ensuring that all "Cauldron" objects are placed on "Exit" tiles as a win condition.

### Plan of Action:
- Fix the comments in the RULES section to ensure they are placed correctly as comments.
- Ensure the PLAYER can push the Olive objects, and develop a rule for adding Olives to the Cauldron.
- Verify that the WINCONDITIONS section aims at placing Cauldrons on the Exit tiles, which is already correct.

Here's the repaired PuzzleScript code:

In this code, the comments have been corrected to appear outside of rule definitions. The rule logic correctly handles the action of pushing Olives and placing them in Cauldrons as part of the game mechanics. The win condition remains the action of aligning Cauldrons on Exit tiles.
