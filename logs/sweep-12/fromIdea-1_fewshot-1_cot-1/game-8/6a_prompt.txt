A port of the luxuriant Wanderlands game, Midas, with permission of the authors.  It's a bit messy, if you can find a way to tidy it UP, let me know : ] 

the original is here

update: uh, it's flash, so not a playable link any more...also the original developer site is gone.

too many errors, aborting compilation
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Olive Odyssey:** Uncover ancient secrets and complex recipes by harvesting ingredients and cooking them into magical, story-altering dishes.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
