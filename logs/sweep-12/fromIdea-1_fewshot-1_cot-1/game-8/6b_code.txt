To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's analyze the errors and make the necessary adjustments:

1. **Line 81 Error:** "Name 'on' referred to in a rule, does not exist."
   - The use of `on` in `Dish on Exit` is incorrect syntax in PuzzleScript. The correct approach involves utilizing conditions and win conditions to manage interactions.

2. **Line 93 Error:** "Key 'L', 'V', '1' not found. Do you need to add it to the legend, or define a new object?"
   - These errors refer to level design lines where unrecognized characters are present. Ensure the levels are correctly defined with known objects.

3. **Line 94-101 Error:** "Maps must be rectangular, yo."
   - This error arises from inconsistent line lengths in level definitions. Levels in PuzzleScript must have uniform dimensions across all rows.

4. **Line 103 Error:** Same as line 93.
   - Again, the level definition includes invalid characters.

Let's correct these issues and rewrite the code accordingly:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Fixed the Syntax Error:**
   - Changed `Dish on Exit` to define an achievable goal: ensuring the `Cauldron` is on `Exit`, requiring the transporting task once the Olive is collected.

2. **Level Characters Corrected:**
   - Ensured only recognized symbols from the legend are used in levels.
 
3. **Added Level Completeness:**
   - Levels are made rectangular, meeting PuzzleScript's requirement for uniform row lengths.

The corrected game reflects a simple objective: move the `Cauldron` to the `Exit` after collecting `Olives`, simulating the demake concept of cooking in a puzzling setup.
