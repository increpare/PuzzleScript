To create a simplified `demake` of the game idea "Tile Tactics" using the PuzzleScript language, I will first break down the core elements of the game and then translate these into PuzzleScript components. 

1. **Core Elements of Tile Tactics:**
   - **Soldiers:** Units that can be placed on the grid by the player.
   - **Grid/Terrain:** The game board where soldiers are positioned.
   - **Objectives:** Acquire strategic points or defeat enemy tiling to win.
   - **Player Commands:** Ability to place, move, and position soldiers.

2. **Translation to PuzzleScript:**
   - **Objects:** Create representations for soldiers, terrain, obstacles (like rocks or water), and objectives.
   - **Player Movement/Action:** Allow the player to control soldiers to achieve objectives, resembling capturing strategic points.
   - **Win Conditions:** Define what constitutes victory, such as occupying specific tiles on the map.
   - **Game Levels:** Create varying terrain configurations and set starting positions.

Given these components, I'll provide a simplified game setup using PuzzleScript.

### Explanation:
- **Objects:**
  - **Background:** Represents the grid on which players and other objects stand.
  - **Soldier:** The unit controlled by the player.
  - **Objective:** Tiles that the player needs to capture or reach with soldiers.
  - **Wall/Water:** Impassable tiles that block or challenge movement.

- **Legend:** Provides convenient shorthand for game objects.
  
- **Rules:** Define simple interaction where the player moves soldiers to occupy objective tiles, while water tiles block movement.
  
- **Win Conditions:** The player wins by moving soldiers onto all objective tiles.

- **Levels:** Offer basic strategic scenarios using obstacles and special tiles.

This setup provides a basic framework for players to engage in tactical positioning within a grid-based environment, directly translating the core mechanics of the given game idea into PuzzleScript.
