To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code and ensure it aligns with the concept of Tile Tactics as a demake, several corrections and adjustments need to be made:

1. **Sound Definition Error**: The error on line 63 indicates an issue with defining a sound. PuzzleScript expects a valid sound verb, but here we provided integer values instead of `MOVE` or `WIN`.

2. **Rule Syntax Error**: On line 79, the comment `# prevents movement over water` is being misinterpreted as part of the rule. PuzzleScript does not support comments like this within the rules section. I will remove the comment to fix the issue.

3. **Legend Definition Errors**: Lines after 91 throw errors related to undefined keys "L" and "E". This might be due to an extra unsupported comment in the levels section.

Taking these into account, hereâ€™s the corrected PuzzleScript code:

### Key Adjustments:
- **Sound Fix**: Remove the erroneous sound codes and replace them with valid `MOVE` and `WIN` placeholders, as PuzzleScript identifies these as sound events but doesn't define their content directly.
- **Comment Removal in Rules**: Removed inline comments in the rules section to prevent syntax errors.
- **Correction of Comment Placement**: Make sure comments don't interfere with level definitions or the game's syntax.
