To address the console errors and improve the game functionality, it seems like the main issue stems from the lack of definition and mapping for the `#` symbol. The `#` symbol is typically used in PuzzleScript for defining walls (or similar blocking elements) in the game. To fix these errors, I will add a Wall object and corresponding legend entry. Additionally, I will ensure that the other game components are correctly configured to create a functioning and enjoyable demake of the Haunted Hues game concept.

Here is the corrected and complete game code:

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Wall Object**: Added a `Wall` object to represent the `#` symbol used in levels. This object is defined as a solid barrier that prevents player movement.
   
2. **Legend Update**: Included the `#` symbol in the legend to correctly map it to the `Wall` object.

3. **Collision Layers**: Ordered layers to include `Wall`, ensuring it blocks player movement and interactions as expected.

These changes should resolve the error messages and allow the game to function as intended, focusing on restoring life to the desaturated world through color palettes, aligning with the core idea of the Haunted Hues game.
