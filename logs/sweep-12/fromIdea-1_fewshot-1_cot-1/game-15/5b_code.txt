To address the errors in your PuzzleScript game code and create a functioning version, let's first outline the identified issues and their solutions:

1. **Color Definition Error**: The code mistakenly interprets "lightyellow" as a misplaced definition. Ensure "ColorTileUnlocked" has valid colors defined properly.

2. **Missing SOUNDS Section**: PuzzleScript requires a SOUNDS section, even if it's empty, before the COLLISIONLAYERS section.

3. **Invalid Object Names in Rules and Win Conditions**: Objects need to be named consistently across objects, rules, and win conditions. Check capitalization and spelling.

4. **Errors in Rule Definitions**: Ensure objects in the rules match those defined in the game, with correct capitalization.

With these points in mind, here's the corrected PuzzleScript game code:

### Explanation:

- **Color Definitions**: The color for "ColorTileUnlocked" is now correctly specified as "yellow yellow" to avoid confusion.
- **SOUNDS Section**: An empty SOUNDS section is added to comply with the PuzzleScript requirements.
- **Consistent Object Names**: Adjustments were made to ensure consistency in object names, particularly in rule conditions and win conditions, matching the defined objects.
- **Correct Rules and Win Conditions**: The rule and win conditions have been adjusted to use the correct capitalization and object naming from the OBJECTS and LEGEND sections.
