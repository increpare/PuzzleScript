To create a simplified demake of the game "Haunted Hues," the goal will be to design a PuzzleScript game where the player restores color to a desaturated world. The key elements of this demake will include:

1. **Player Character:** A controllable avatar that the player uses to interact with the game world.
2. **Desaturated Tiles:** These represent the "haunted" parts of the world that need to be colorized.
3. **Color Palettes:** Objects that, when collected, restore color to adjacent desaturated tiles.
4. **Colorized Tiles:** Tiles that become vibrant when restored.

Key mechanics will be:
- Collecting color palettes unlocks or transforms adjacent desaturated tiles into colorized tiles.
- The objective will be to transform all desaturated tiles into colorized ones to win the game.

The game code will utilize the PuzzleScript framework, with defined objects, collision layers, rules for interactions, and win conditions. 

Here's an example implementation using the PuzzleScript language:

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** Defined the game objects: the player, desaturated tiles, color palettes, and the colored background.
- **Legend:** Maps single-character representations to the defined objects.
- **Rules:** Basic rules to handle collecting color palettes and restoring colors to tiles.
- **Win Condition:** The game ends when no desaturated tiles remain.
- **Levels:** Example level configuration with desaturated tiles and color palettes. **Message** provides an objective to the player. 

This setup allows the player to move around and restore colors by interacting with the palettes, fulfilling the concept of "Haunted Hues" in a compact form.
