+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 2. Propagate obstructions backwards )
[ > Mover  | stationary Obstacle ] -> [ stationary Mover | Obstacle ]

	(the next lines deal with directional conflicts)

Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Pirate Plunge:** Navigate shifting seas and evade rival buccaneers to collect hidden treasure on a cursed archipelago..
