Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Pirate Plunge:** Navigate shifting seas and evade rival buccaneers to collect hidden treasure on a cursed archipelago.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
