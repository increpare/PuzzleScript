To repair the given PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the errors found during the compilation process. Here's a summary of what's necessary and the steps involved:

1. **Color Definition for `Island`:** The error messages indicate that the `Island` object is trying to access more colors than defined. This suggests that the object is intended to have multiple colors, but only one has been specified, which is causing the error. We should define a multi-color pattern for `Island`.

2. **Color Name for `ShiftingSea`:** PuzzleScript expects colors to be numeric indices into a palette, but "Cyan" was specified as a name. We should redefine it using numeric initializer values for colors.

3. **Pattern for `ShiftingSea`:** Patterns for PuzzleScript objects use numbers to indicate different colors in a sprite, and these numbers refer to the palette defined within the object. We need to ensure the pattern for `ShiftingSea` uses numeric indices that correspond to colors.

Given these issues, the following code includes a complete `Pirate Plunge` game, suitably repaired:

**Changes Made:**

- **Island Object Color Correction:** Defined multiple colors (`green` and `LightGreen`) to create a pattern for `Island`.
- **ShiftingSea Object Colors Fixed:** Defined `lightblue` and `cyan` as color indices array for `ShiftingSea`.
- Adjusted the pattern of the `ShiftingSea` to support numeric indices, matching the sprite colors.
