Let's break down the errors and address them:

1. **Color Error for ShiftingSea:** The error output indicates a problem with the color indices for the `ShiftingSea` object. The `ShiftingSea` object has colors defined for two layers but seems to expect more. Since other objects have only one color, it's better to mimic that style for consistency. We'll redefine `ShiftingSea` with a single layer.

2. **Sound Errors:** PuzzleScript syntax for including sounds in rules might require the sound to be predefined correctly in the `SOUNDS` section. We'll adjust these sections to standard use or potentially eliminate them if necessary as placeholders don't seem to work further on logic.

3. **Rules Errors:** 
    - I suspect the conditions requiring transformation items to sound tokens directly need rethinking.
    - Due to the `<Action> sound` form potentially not defined or supported like direct object manipulation.

4. **Rule Implementations:** Implement transformations without sounds to keep it functional, even at the cost of losing that game aspect.

Here's a revised code with these elements fixed:

Here's what has been done:
- Fixed the `ShiftingSea` object's color definitions to avoid index out of bounds errors.
- Removed sound tokens from rules as a redundancy fix/check.
- Applied rule simplifications and structural corrections while maintaining core game functionality.

Make sure you test the code against your specific game implementation needs and adjust where necessary, due to PuzzleScript's limited debugging capacity without its own advanced utilities.
