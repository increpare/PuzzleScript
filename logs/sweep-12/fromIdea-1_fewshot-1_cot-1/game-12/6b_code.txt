To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to consider the specific errors reported by the console output. Here's how we can fix the game code step by step:

1. **Object Dimensions**: Each sprite must be exactly 5x5 pixels. The `Island` and `ShiftingSea` objects have sprite patterns that are empty (just dots), which is valid as long as they are 5x5. 
   
2. **Sound Section**: The sounds section is commented out correctly if unwanted or unused. Ensure there's no extra syntax related to sound that goes unused.

3. **Rules Consistency**: Each pattern on the left must have a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length. We should adjust the rules to ensure equivalent patterns on both sides of the rule operations.

Below is the corrected version of the game code:

### Explanation:
- **Sprites**: Ensure all object sprites are 5x5 pixels.
- **Rules Consistency**: Adjusted to ensure rules transfer correctly from before to after the transformation.
- **Island and ShiftingSea Representation**: Use dot patterns correctly, keeping consistent with rules.
