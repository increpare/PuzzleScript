To create a simplified demake of the game idea "Haunted Hues" in the PuzzleScript language, we will need to create a game where the player must interact with tiles to restore colors to a desaturated grid. Here is a plan to achieve this:

### Plan:
1. **Define the Objects:**
   - `Background`: A simple desaturated background tile.
   - `Player`: The character controlled by the player.
   - `ColorTile`: Tiles which, when interacted with, will change the background to a vibrant color.
   - `Wall`: Impassable tiles that constrain the movement area.
   - `Target`: The goal or exit that opens when all `ColorTiles` are uncovered.

2. **Define the Legend:**
   - Assign unique symbols to each object for easy reference in level design.

3. **Set up Collision Layers:**
   - Determine the layers of interaction (e.g., background, player, obstacles).

4. **Establish Rules:**
   - Rules that allow the player to reveal colors when interacting with `ColorTiles`.
   - Movement rules for the player.
   - Game-winning condition: when all `ColorTiles` are activated.

5. **Win Conditions:**
   - Define what it means to win the game, such as activating all `ColorTiles`.

6. **Design Levels:**
   - Create one or more levels to demonstrate the game's mechanics.

Now, using the plan above, let's write the PuzzleScript code.

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** We've defined basic objects such as `Player`, `Wall`, `ColorTile`, and `Background`.
- **Legend:** Mapped symbols to objects.
- **Collision Layers:** Ensured tiles are ordered correctly so they interact and display properly.
- **Rules:** The main interaction is between the `Player` and `ColorTile`, which transforms `ColorTile` into an `ActivatedTile`.
- **Win Conditions:** The player wins when all `ColorTiles` have been activated to `ActivatedTiles`.
- **Levels:** Provided a simple starting level to illustrate the game's objectives and mechanics.

This code snippet provides a foundation for a simple game focused on uncovering hidden colors and transforming a desaturated world into a vibrant one.
