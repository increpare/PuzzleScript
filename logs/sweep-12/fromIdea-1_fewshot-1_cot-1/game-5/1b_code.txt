To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code and bring it in line with the theme "Haunted Hues," we'll need to make a few changes. Here's a plan to correct the code:

1. **Fix the ColorTile Object Definition:** The error mentions that we're trying to access a color that isn't defined in the `ColorTile` object. We need to define two colors for each sprite: a main color and a background color.

2. **Correct the Sound Definition:** The line defining the sound effect was in the wrong place. We need to move it to the correct section under `SOUNDS`, using the proper format.

3. **Adjust the Sprite Dimensions:** All sprite definitions need to be 5x5, but it seems this is already correctly implemented in this code.

4. **Correct Rule Syntax:** Ensure the rule for transforming `ColorTile` to `ActivatedTile` is properly formatted, as there was a syntax issue involving the `activate` token.

5. **Check Rule for Sounds:** Ensure the syntax for triggering sounds when rules activate is correct.

Let's adjust the code accordingly:

### Explanation:
- **ColorTile and ActivatedTile Colors:** Added a background color to ensure the color palette has two colors.
- **Sound Definition Corrected:** Placed the sound effect declaration under `SOUNDS` and ensured it is referenced correctly in the rule using `sfx`.
- **Rule Syntax:** Used `sfx activate` to tie the sound effect to the transformation rule.
- **Sprite Dimensions:** Kept the `5x5` as-is for all objects, which you initially implemented correctly.

These adjustments bring the game in line with PuzzleScript's requirements and implement the theme of "restoring color" to a previously black-and-white world.
