An inadequate but illustrative demake of one of my favourite puzzle games ever, by the extremely amicable Lexaloffle, and with his permission.

[ > Warpball] [Wizard] -> [] [> Wizard]
(Wizards telexport. What they really do is shoot a "warpball", which causes them to move normally if it hits a wall or the edge of the screen and warp if it hits something they can warp with.)

(Druid does his thing. Warpball gets reused as a placeholder here. That's gonna happen a lot.)

[Warpball | Healer] -> [Saved | Healer]
[Warpball Hero] -> [Wall Sfx8]
(What strategic purpose could it serve for healers to protect against petrification? None, but it's fun.)

(I mean, theoretically you could write some horrid dragon breath timing puzzle where the ability to delay an extra turn without moving or switching characters is necessary in order to let you move someone else at the correct moment, but even if dragons still existed, that sounds like a really gross level.)

(Bard moves stuff. Reusing "WarpBall" for totally different purpose, so we can cancel the move if he doesn't move.)

[> Note] [Note] -> [> Note] [> Note]
[> Note Moveable | no Static no Moveable no Bard] -> [| Moveable Sfx7]
+[> Note Bard WarpBall| no Static no Moveable no Bard] -> [| Bard]

(Why are we doing this pseudo-movement instead of using the built-in version? Because using movement directions makes the note-adding stuff way easier below, and you can't use movement directions in the LATE phase, so the actual moving has to be done before then.)

[WarpBall] -> Cancel

[ Action Druid] [SPriest] -> [SDruid] [Priest Sfx1]

[ Action Fighter] [SDruid] -> [SFighter] [Druid Sfx1]
[ Action Thief] [SFighter] -> [SThief] [Fighter Sfx1]
[ Action Wizard] [SThief] -> [SWizard] [Thief Sfx1]

[ Action Bard] [SPriest] -> [SBard] [Priest Sfx1]
[ Action Druid] [SBard] -> [SDruid] [Bard Sfx1]

(Bard plays music. This is my favorite part of the code, btw. Yes, you can make square area effects with just one object!)
[no Note | no Note | Bard] -> [^ Note | ^ Note | Bard]
[no Note | Bard] -> [^ Note | Bard]
[> Note | no Note | no Note] -> [Note | Note | Note]
[> Note | no Note] -> [Note | Note]
[> Note] -> [Note]

(Now enemies attack. Yeah, there's only one kind of enemy now.)

Late [Goblin | Vulnerable] -> [Goblin | Dying Vulnerable]

(Vulnerable objects that are attacked are designated as "Dying", but heroes can be saved by the Priest. Then the stuff that didn't get saved dies.)

Late [Dying Healer] -> [Saved Healer]
Late [Healer | Dying Hero] -> [Healer | Saved Hero]
Late [Dying Monster] -> [Sfx5]
Late [Dying Hero] -> [Corpse Sfx6]

(Doors opening.)

late [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor] -> [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [YellowOpen] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor sfx2]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowOpen sfx3]

late [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor] -> [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [PurpleOpen] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor sfx2]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleOpen sfx3]

late [MonsterDoor] -> [ShadowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] [Monster] -> [MonsterDoor] [Monster]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [sfx3]

(Looks for a HasSavedDoor and, if there is one, puts a warpball on the Priest. Then, if someone was saved this turn, plays the sound only if the Priest doesn't have the warpball. Finally, cleans that up.)

late [HasSavedDoor] [Healer] -> [Goal] [Healer WarpBall]
late [Saved] [Healer no WarpBall] -> [Saved sfx4] [Healer]
late [HasSavedDoor] -> [Goal]
late [WarpBall] -> []

late [Note no Moveable] -> []

Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Haunted Hues:** Restore life to a desaturated, haunted world by unlocking vibrant color palettes hidden within cleverly camouflaged tiles.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
