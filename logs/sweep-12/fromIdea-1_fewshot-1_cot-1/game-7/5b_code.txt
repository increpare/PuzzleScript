To repair the given PuzzleScript game code, I first need to analyze the error messages and understand what may be causing them. The error messages indicate that there are keys ("A", "S", "I", "C", "M", "O") that are not found, which suggests that there might be a mistake or oversight in the level definitions or the legend section where the objects corresponding to these keys are either missing or incorrectly referenced.

From the error messages and the context provided, it appears that the issue might stem from either a mistake in the level definitions referencing undefined objects, or potentially an unnecessary reference somewhere that includes these additional keys. However, since these specific keys do not correspond to any object definitions, it suggests there might be an errant line or a typo that contains these letters.

Here's an adjusted version of the script that addresses these suspected issues by ensuring that only proper object definitions and valid keys are used throughout the code:

Note that I've reviewed the level definitions to ensure no undefined objects or keys ("A", "S", "I", "C", "M", "O") are being referenced. If these keys were intended to refer to additional mechanics or objects, they would need to be properly defined in the `OBJECTS` and `LEGEND` sections. If they were mistakenly included, simply removing any errant lines resolving these errors.
