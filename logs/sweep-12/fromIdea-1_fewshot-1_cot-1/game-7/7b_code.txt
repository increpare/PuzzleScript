To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the issues related to undefined keys mentioned in the console output. The keys "A", "S", "I", "C", "M", and "O" do not appear in the levels or the provided game code, which suggests that there may be a misunderstanding or typographical error elsewhere in the script. Let's review and tidy up the code to ensure all elements are properly defined and utilized.

Here is the plan to address the issue:

1. **Audit Definitions**: Ensure all objects, legend entries, and collision layers are correctly defined and used.
2. **Review Rules**: Ensure all movement and transformation rules make sense and align with object definitions.
3. **Simplify and Correct Levels**: Review level designs to ensure they only include keys and objects defined in the game.

Here is the complete revised code:

### Explanation
- **Correct Definitions**: All objects listed in the levels are defined in the `OBJECTS` section.
- **Legend**: Ensure all keys ("P", "B", "R", "H", "G", "#", "X") appear elsewhere in the code where expected.
- **Collision Layers**: Include all objects in collision layers to ensure proper interaction rules.
- **Rules**: Adjust rules such that they transfer and manage objects as describedâ€”crucially, rules that affect object interaction and transformation.
- **Levels**: Simplify and check levels only include keys defined in the legend.

This revision should compile without errors and maintain the gameplay intended for a "demake" based on the utilization of mechanical wildlife objects.
