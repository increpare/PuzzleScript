In PuzzleScript, any text after the `LEVELS` section is strictly interpreted as the level design, where each line corresponds to rows in the level's grid. Any characters used in this section need to be defined as part of the objects or the legend symbols previously in the script.

From the errors noted in the console output above, it appears that the level names and comments have been interpreted as part of the level design, hence the errors about undefined keys like "L", "E", "V", etc. The comments should instead be moved above the `LEVELS` section to prevent them from being read as game elements.

Here is the corrected game code:

Key Considerations:
- Moved comments describing levels above the `LEVELS` section to ensure they're not read as level data.
- Ensured that each defined object and legend symbol is correctly used in the game code.
- Adjusted the levels to use defined symbols, ensuring they can compile without errors.

This repaired version should compile successfully, allowing the game to run as intended.
