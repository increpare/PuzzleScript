The error messages indicate that there are undefined keys in the `RULES` section, specifically on line 119. To address this, I need to review the entire game script and ensure that all objects and interactions are properly defined in the `LEGEND` and `OBJECTS` sections. Additionally, I'll ensure all aspects align with the simplified "Mechanimal" theme, where the player interacts with mechanical animals (birds and rhinos) to solve puzzles.

Here is the revised code, with the missing keys addressed and clear gameplay design implemented:

In this repaired version, I ensured that each object mentioned in the `RULES` and `LEVELS` sections is defined in the `LEGEND`. The game now represents a simplified version of the game idea, allowing players to interact with mechanical animals to solve environmental puzzles.
