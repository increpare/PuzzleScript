The error messages indicate that the keywords `move_sound` and `goal_reached` used in the `SOUNDS` section are incorrect. In PuzzleScript, you should use `SFXn` where `n` is a number, such as `SFX0`, `SFX1`, and so on. Each `SFXn` can be associated with a sound effect emitted when a rule that mentions the sound effect is triggered.

To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Correct the sound effect identifiers in the `SOUNDS` section using `SFXn`.
2. Replace incorrectly referenced sound effect names in the rules with the corrected identifiers.

Here's the repaired version of the code that addresses these issues:

Here's a summary of the changes made:
- Replaced `move_sound` with `SFX0` for player movement and rhino movements.
- Replaced `goal_reached` with `SFX1` for reaching the goal.
- Updated the `SOUNDS` section to define `SFX0` and `SFX1` with appropriate sound effect codes.
