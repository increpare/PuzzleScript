To fix the code, we need to address a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Sound Usage:** The "unexpected sound token" errors are likely due to incorrect syntax. Sounds in PuzzleScript games should be tied to specific actions. We'll define sound effects with unique identifiers and use them correctly in the rules.

2. **Syntax Errors in Rules:** The error "Name 'sfx'" suggests incorrect sound effect usage. In PuzzleScript, sound effects are triggered by actions such as object movement or transformation. We'll correctly refer to the sounds by name.

3. **Ensure Correct Rule Logic:** We'll review the rules to ensure each game mechanic is correctly implemented and sound effects are triggered when expected.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

### Key Changes Made:
- **Sound Effects**: Defined two sound effects "move_sound" and "goal_reached" and tied them to corresponding actions using their correct identifiers.
- **Rule Adjustments**: Updated the rule actions to trigger sound effects internally by applying their name after the action.
  
This fixed version should now compile and run correctly with sound effects attached to the player and goal interactions, aligning with the game's intended design.
