To create a PuzzleScript game based on the concept of **Mechanimal**, I will follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the Concept**: Reduce the complexity of the original idea to fit within the constraints of a PuzzleScript game. The main idea will focus on players befriending mechanical animals and using them strategically to navigate an environment.

2. **Define Game Mechanics**:
   - The player can control mechanical animals.
   - Animals will have different abilities (e.g., flying, pushing, or bridging).
   - The player can combine animals to solve puzzles (e.g., a bird can lift the player across gaps).

3. **Design Objects and Environment**:
   - Create a player character.
   - Design different types of mechanical animals.
   - Create environmental elements like gaps and obstacles.
   - Design goals or exits the player must reach.

4. **Rules and Interactions**:
   - Define interactions between the player and animals.
   - Create rules that allow animals to demonstrate their abilities.
   - Establish win conditions and any possible loss conditions.

5. **Write the PuzzleScript Code**:
   - Include object definitions.
   - Outline the game rules.
   - Design levels using the defined objects and mechanics.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code for the simplified **Mechanimal** game:

### Breakdown of the Game:
- **Objects**: Each object represents a player, mechanical animals (Bird and Rhino), environmental elements (Gap and Wall), and the objective (Goal).
- **Mechanics**:
  - The player can control birds to fly over gaps or ride rhinos to move them.
  - Rhinos can transform into bridges when moved onto gaps.
- **Objective**: Navigate the environment using the animals to reach the goal.
  
Through these simplified mechanics, the game illustrates the concept of befriending and using mechanical creatures to solve puzzles on a lost planet.
