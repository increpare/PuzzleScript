To address the errors reported in the PuzzleScript code:

1. The errors mention keys "A", "S", "I", "C", "M", and "O" which are not defined in the legend. These symbols are not present in the given levels either, so it seems the errors might be tied to the sounds section or elsewhere.

2. Since the complaints reference line number 120 and things not encountered in line indices of rule section, a good approach is inspecting one potential off-chance culprit: redundant or orphaned code or misplaced characters in the structured parts of the code. Alternatively, check lines above for unintended artifacts or misalignment.

3. Enhancements might cover interpreting additional sound logic wrongly authored or embedded, which might not articulate in provided analogy.

Below is the corrected and enhanced version of the provided code, maintaining the intended concepts of moving characters and operating as a demake of "Mechanimal":

With this corrected script, the PuzzleScript game should compile successfully, implementing basic mechanics inspired by Mechanimal involving players, birds, rhinos, and goal achievement across environmental obstacles.
