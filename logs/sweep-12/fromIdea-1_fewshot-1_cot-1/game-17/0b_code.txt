To create a simplified `demake` of the `Mechanimal` game idea using the PuzzleScript language, we'll follow these steps:

1. Define the game concept:
   - The main objective is to collect and assemble mechanical animals (Mechanimals) to solve environmental puzzles.
   - Players can control both the player character and the assembled Mechanimals.
   - Use the Mechanimal abilities to overcome obstacles.

2. Simplify the design:
   - The player character will be able to collect parts to assemble a Mechanimal.
   - Each assembled Mechanimal can provide unique abilities like moving over water or pushing blocks.
   - A winning condition could involve reaching a specified target or completing a task using the Mechanimal's abilities.

3. Define key game elements:
   - Player character
   - Mechanimal parts
   - Assembled Mechanimal
   - Obstacles like water or blocks

4. Develop simple game mechanics:
   - Player can collect parts to assemble a Mechanimal.
   - Mechanimal can overcome specific obstacles or perform special actions.
   - Player and Mechanimal work together to solve puzzles.

5. Implement basic levels to showcase these mechanics.

Here is the PuzzleScript code:

This code provides a basic framework for the game, where the player collects parts to assemble a Mechanimal, which is then used to reach the target. The player's abilities are limited initially but expanded by constructing the Mechanimal. As a prototype, this offers a starting point to explore more features or enhance the mechanics as needed.
