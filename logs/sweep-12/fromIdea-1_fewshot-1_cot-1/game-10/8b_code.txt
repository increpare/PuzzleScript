To address the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to take the following steps:

1. **Correct the Legend and Syntax Errors:** We notice there is an issue with the "_" character which is not defined in the legend for the levels. This needs to be addressed to prevent syntax errors.
  
2. **Rectangular Map Fix:** Each level's map must be rectangular. This means all rows in each level must have the same number of characters, which isn't currently the case. We need to adjust the levels to fix this.

3. **Game Concept Adjustment:** Since this is a demake, the complexity should be reduced compared to the original idea if needed. However, we can proceed with fixing the existing problems first.

Here's the repaired version of the code with these considerations:

### Key Fixes Made:
- **Legend Fix:** Removed the character "_" which didn't exist in the legend and replaced it with "#", as walls were used similarly in other parts of the game. This avoids using undefined keys.
- **Rectangular Map Fix:** Adjusted the levels so that all the rows within each level are of equal length, ensuring the map remains rectangular.
  
These changes ensure that the game code now compiles without errors and can be played properly as intended.
