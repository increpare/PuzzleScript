To ensure the levels are solvable, the player should have a clear path to move seeds from their starting position to the castles. Adjusting the positions of elements in the levels will help make them solvable. Here's an updated version of the game:

In this adjusted version, I've made sure the player can access both the seeds and the castles while allowing for growth from seed to sprout to crop. The player can now move seeds and sprout them on the soil in front of castles to complete the levels.
