Certainly! Here's a revised version of the PuzzleScript game `Crops & Knights` with solvable levels. I'll simplify the concept and ensure that each level can be completed. I've also refined the winning condition, and added interactions based on the provided theme.

### Notes:
- I changed the win condition to check for "All Castle on Crop" to ensure it aligns better with farming and territory commands.
- Ensured the positioning of seeds, sprouts, crops, and castle so each level can be solved following progression of plants.
- Adjusted walls and layout to make sure every crop has a clear path to grow under the castle. 

You can adjust this further depending on additional complexity or features you wish to add!
