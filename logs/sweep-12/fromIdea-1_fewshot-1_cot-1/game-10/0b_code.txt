To create a simplified PuzzleScript demake of the concept "Crops & Castles," we need to distill the core mechanics of farming and tower defense into gameplay suitable for PuzzleScript. Here are the key elements to consider:

1. **Farming & Harvesting:** Represented by a player character able to move over plots of soil to plant and harvest crops.
2. **Enchanted Produce:** Crops provide spells or defenses, symbolized by different blocks or stages of crop growth.
3. **Protecting the Kingdom:** The battlefield or castle represents your kingdom, with walls or castles to defend.
4. **Enemy Threats:** Simplified to static obstacles or challenge conditions rather than active enemies due to PuzzleScript's limitations.

### Plan:

1. **Objects:**
   - **Player:** The entity controlled by the user to plant and harvest.
   - **Soil/Crop Stages:** Represent various stages from planted seeds to grown crops.
   - **Castle:** Protectable object akin to a home base.
   - **Obstacle/Wall:** Represents defending structures or enemies.

2. **Rules:**
   - Allow the player to plant and harvest crops, which could change stages upon interaction.
   - Conditional win when crops are grown, possibly representing a powered-up kingdom.

3. **Win Conditions:**
   - All crops should be fully grown, symbolizing a successful harvest for the kingdom.

4. **Levels:**
   - Simple layout with a mix of soil, player start position, and the castle to defend.

Here is the implementation code for this simplified concept:

**Explanation:**
- The player can move over soil (`s`) to transform it through stages of growing crops (from `Seed` to `Sprout` to `Crop`).
- The `Castle` (`H`) must be protected, represented as a static win condition to have all `Sprout` tiles converted to `Crop`.
- Levels are crafted to provide initial challenge and invoke strategic movement.

This approach condenses the "Crops & Castles" concept into a manageable PuzzleScript game scenario.
