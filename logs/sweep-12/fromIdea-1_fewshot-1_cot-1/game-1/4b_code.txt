To address the compilation errors and ensure the game code adheres to PuzzleScript's requirements, I will make the following changes:

1. **Win Conditions**: Correct the formatting to match the required syntax, which involves using keywords like "ALL", "SOME", or "NO" to define win conditions.
2. **Legend Keys**: Ensure all elements used in the levels are defined in the legend.
3. **Level Syntax**: Correct errors in object definitions used in levels to match those in the legend.
4. **Overall Structure**: Ensure the game logic aligns with the intended gameplay: guiding the player to find treasures and navigate through traps.

Here's the corrected code:

**Key Changes**:
- **Win Conditions**: Correctly introduced with "All Player on Exit" to specify that the sole player must reach the exit.
- **Legend**: Covered all symbols used in the levels. These ensure level setups reference valid objects.
- **Level Definitions**: Verified the correctness of the character placement in each level design, corresponding with defined legend characters.

The repaired script should compile without errors, allowing the player to solve puzzles by moving the boulder and navigating obstacles to reach the exit.
