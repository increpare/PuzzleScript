To address the errors reported in the code, we need to ensure that the color definitions for the `Trap` and `Exit` objects are correctly defined. Specifically, the `Trap` and `Exit` objects have incomplete or incorrect color configuration, which caused the errors. We should ensure color configurations have the correct number of colors specified in the pattern.

Here is the revised version of the code, correcting the errors and maintaining the essence of the game:

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Colors for Trap and Exit:**
   - Added an extra color for both `Trap` and `Exit` to ensure there are sufficient colors when accessing the palette.

2. **General Structure:**
   - All necessary aspects from the original code are kept intact to maintain the overall functionality and feel of the game.

3. **Game Idea Simplification:**
   - Focused on the logic puzzle aspect by having boulders that must be pushed onto targets, introducing walls and traps for complexity. 

These fixes should ensure the game compiles without errors, allowing players to experience the intended "puzzle and treasure" dynamics.
