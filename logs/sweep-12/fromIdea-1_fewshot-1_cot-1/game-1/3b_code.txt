To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we should focus on the following issues from the provided console output and description:

1. The syntax error in the rules section: PuzzleScript doesn't support comments in the rules section.
2. The erroneous "if" statement: PuzzleScript does not use conditional statements like traditional programming languages.
3. Correct rule application: Rules should specify object interactions directly.

Given the provided game idea inspiration ("Puzzlot"), we want a simple sokoban-like game with traps that require puzzle-solving skills to navigate through the labyrinth and reach treasures. The code should ensure that the player's interaction with traps results in a level restart, and rearrange the rules to fit PuzzleScript's requirements.

Here's the repaired version of the provided game code:
