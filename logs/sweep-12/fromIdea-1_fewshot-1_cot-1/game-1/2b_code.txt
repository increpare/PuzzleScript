To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code:

1. The error messages indicate that the engine couldn't recognize the colors for "Exit" and "Treasure." This issue arises because "Gold" and "DarkYellow" are not among the standard color names recognized in PuzzleScript. We need to replace them with valid color names.

2. Let's replace "Gold" with "Yellow" and "DarkYellow" with a more appropriate contrast such as "Orange," which are valid colors in PuzzleScript.

3. We also need to check that the 'RULES' section and other parts adhere correctly to game logic. The game should feature logic puzzles, carefully placing boulders on targets and avoiding traps.

Here is the corrected code:
