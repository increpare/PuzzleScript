To create a simplified `demake` of the game idea **Puzzlot** in PuzzleScript, we need to distill the concept into basic components suitable for the language's capabilities. PuzzleScript is great for grid-based games with simple mechanics. Here's how we can translate the idea:

1. **Puzzles**: We'll implement a simple puzzle mechanic—players need to push movable boulders onto target spaces to open the exit to a new room.

2. **Rooms and Treasures**: Each level will represent a room. Completing a puzzle in a room will reveal a "treasure" (simply a visual element) and open the path to the next room.

3. **Traps**: Traps can be static obstacles that reset the player’s position if touched.

4. **Labyrinth**: The labyrinth will be simulated by multiple levels in PuzzleScript.

**Game Design Elements:**
- **Player**: Movable entity that pushes boulders.
- **Boulder**: Movable block that can be moved onto targets.
- **Target**: A space where boulders need to be placed.
- **Wall**: Static objects that block movement.
- **Trap**: Static objects that reset the player position.
- **Exit**: Player reaches this after solving the puzzle to progress to the next "room" (level).

**Implementation Plan:**
- Create the necessary objects and their visual representations.
- Define movement and pushing mechanics in the rules.
- Develop simple levels that incorporate all elements.

Here's the complete code:

**Explanation:**
- Each level is designed to incrementally introduce game elements such as traps.
- The rules enforce the primary mechanics, such as pushing boulders and resetting on traps.
- The win condition checks if all boulders are on targets, and reaching the exit with all targets covered signifies level completion.
- Each level represents a new "room" in the labyrinth with simple logic problems to solve. 

This design caters to a basic experience of **Puzzlot**'s core gameplay.
