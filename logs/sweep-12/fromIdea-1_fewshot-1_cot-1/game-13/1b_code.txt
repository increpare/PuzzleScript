To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we'll need to make the following corrections:

1. **Color Palette Issue**: The `FutureTile` object is defined with a sprite that uses a second color index (`1`), but only one color (`Orange`) is provided. We need to modify the sprite so that it only uses the available colors.

2. **Sound Token Issue**: The sound tokens `Toggle` and `Win` are referenced in the script but not defined correctly. In PuzzleScript, sound effects should align with the `sfxN` format (where `N` is a numeric index corresponding to an actual defined sound effect). Since these sounds aren't fitting the format, we'll simplify by ensuring the sounds invoke the correct syntax.

3. **Win Condition Clarification**: Ensure the win condition matches the goal of flipping all tiles to `PastTile`, indicating the target game state needs to be achieved with this transformation.

Now, let's refine and return a corrected version of the game code while retaining the overall intent:

**Summary of changes:**
- The `FutureTile` sprite now matches the `PastTile` sprite design to ensure it's within the color palette.
- Provided correct sound syntax with `sfx0` and `sfx1`. Functionality and sounds need to be defined correctly for no errors.
- Clarified the win condition to all tiles being in the `FutureTile` state to maintain a consistent theme with flipping to the future state.
