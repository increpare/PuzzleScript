An inadequate but illustrative demake of one of my favourite puzzle games ever, by the extremely amicable Lexaloffle, and with his permission.

www.lexaloffle.com/neko.htm

The game proper has a lot of magic and love in it.

( up [ action player ] [ Crate | Crate ] -> [ action player ] [ Crate Crate_u | Crate Crate_d ] )

(Step 1: propagate motions forward)

(Step 1: If a crate can't move, we have to back-propagate the can't-move-ness, including possibly through players)

(Step 3: Mark all crates that are still moving as possibly being able to move)
[ moving Pushable ] -> [ Pushable CanMove ]

(Step 4: redo Step 1, but only through things that are marked as being possibly able to move)
[ > Pusher | CanMove Pushable ] -> [ > Pusher | CanMove > Pushable ]
