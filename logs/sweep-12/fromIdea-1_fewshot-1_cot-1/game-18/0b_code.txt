To create a simplified "demake" of a game called "Olive Odyssey" in PuzzleScript, we need to strip down the concept into a minimalistic puzzle game format. The main elements of the game idea involve harvesting ingredients and cooking them into dishes. In a simplified PuzzleScript version, we can break this down into:

1. **Objects:**
   - **Player:** The character that can move around and perform actions.
   - **Ingredients:** Collectible items scattered around the level, similar to crates but thematic to olives and other ingredients.
   - **Cauldron:** A stationary object where the player brings ingredients to cook them.
   - **Dishes:** The resultant items after ingredients are cooked. For simplicity, transform the ingredients into dishes when they are delivered to the cauldron.

2. **Mechanics:**
   - Players collect the ingredients by stepping on them.
   - Deliver ingredients by moving them to the cauldron to create dishes. The challenge is built around the placement and movement strategy to optimize the cooking.

3. **Goals:**
   - The victory condition could involve cooking a certain number of dishes by adding ingredients to the cauldron.

Here's the complete code for the simplified game in PuzzleScript:

### Explanation:

- **Objects**: We define six objects representing the player, three types of ingredients (Olive, Herb, Garlic), a cauldron, and a dish.
- **Rules**: 
  - When the player moves over an ingredient, the ingredient is collected, and a dish is created.
  - When the player moves to the cauldron, any held ingredients are converted into dishes.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won if any dishes have been cooked.
- **Levels**: A sample level is included where the goal is to move ingredients to the cauldron, creating dishes and achieving the win condition.

This game is straightforward and encapsulates the essence of "harvesting and cooking," providing room for players to plan their captures and deliveries efficiently.
