To address the errors and improve the PuzzleScript game code, we need to make several corrections. Here's the plan:

1. **Correct the Sprite Sizes**: All sprites must be 5x5. We'll ensure each object has a sprite of the correct size with RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values for respective colors.

2. **Fix Color Palette Issues**: Ensure that each color used in the sprite patterns matches the defined palette.

3. **Update Sounds**: Correct the sound behavior rules to use appropriate sound verbs like `CREATE`.

4. **Simplify Mechanics**: Adjust game mechanics to reflect a basic collection and cooking task.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

### Reasoning

- **Sprite Definition**: We have ensured 5x5 sprites for each object with corrected colors. For Garlic and Dish, we've reduced the number of colors used to match the sprite patterns, which were mistakenly using undefined colors.
  
- **Sound Definitions**: The use of `sfx0` and `sfx1` now properly corresponds to `CREATE` actions when picking up ingredients and creating a dish in the cauldron.

- **Game Rules**: Simplified to encourage discovering ingredients (Olive, Herb, Garlic) and converting them to Dish at the Cauldron without extraneous complexity.

This streamlines the game to focus on collecting and cooking ingredients into dishes, aligning with the core concept of uncovering secrets through culinary discoveries.
