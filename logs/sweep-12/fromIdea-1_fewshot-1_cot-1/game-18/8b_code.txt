For the level to be solvable, the player must be able to push each ingredient into the cauldron. The second level is added as an example of solvability. In the first level, due to positioning, no ingredients can be moved to the cauldron, causing the unsolvable error. The second level rearranges ingredients to ensure the player can create a dish by moving them into the cauldron.
