To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game, we need to focus on the sprite definitions where the errors occur. The specific error messages indicate that the game is trying to use colors in the sprites that haven't been defined. For each sprite, the number of colors declared should match what is actually used in the sprite definition.

Let's review each offending sprite and adjust their definitions:

1. **Garlic**: The game attempted to use a color indexed as "2", but only defined two colors. We must define three colors, using indices: 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Cauldron**: Similarly, we must define four colors because the sprite access involves indices up to "3".
3. **Dish**: Again, we must define enough colors for the indices used, which go up to "4".

After these adjustments, the code should compile without errors. Here is the corrected version of your game code:
