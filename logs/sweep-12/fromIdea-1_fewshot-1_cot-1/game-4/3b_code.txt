To address the errors and create a functional version of "Railway Riddle," I will follow these steps:

1. **Correct the Section Order:** Ensure that `COLLISIONLAYERS` appears after `SOUNDS`, even if `SOUNDS` is empty. All section headings must be included in the correct order to avoid compilation errors.

2. **Ensure Case Consistency:** Verify that object names are consistent and correctly capitalized. The existing capitalization should match consistently in all parts of the code, such as object definitions, legend definitions, and rules.

3. **Complete the Game Structure:** Ensure that all necessary sections and headings are present, even if they are empty.

Here is the repaired version of the game code:

**Key Corrections:**
- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section to ensure the correct order of sections.
- Ensured that object names in rules are consistent with their definitions (capitalized consistently as defined in the `LEGEND` section).
- Checked that the game logic connects tracks correctly based on player movement while allowing for interaction with different elements like Towns and Obstacles.
