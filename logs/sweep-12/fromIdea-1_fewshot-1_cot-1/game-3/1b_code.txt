To fix the errors, we need to address the color indices used for the Player and the other objects. The errors indicate that the code is attempting to access color indices that aren't defined in the respective sprites' color data.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Define proper colors for each object:**
   - Ensure that each object has the correct number of colors and that these indices are referenced correctly.

2. **Verify color palettes:** 
   - Check that the number of colors chosen is correctly represented by indices and mapping.

Here's the corrected version of your game code:

### Explanation:

- **Player's color definition:** I replaced the color indices with `0` and `1`, representing two shades (although for simplicity, they can remain just a single color which might be less visually appealing but structurally correct given these indices.) In this instance, 0 is used simply for the main color.

- **Tiles' color definitions:** All indices used (0) now reference the single color defined for `PastTile` and `FutureTile`.

- **Each object palette is set to use indices correctly**, ensuring valid references, resolving the out-of-bounds color errors in the original script. This change will compile without access errors and represents basic gameplay logic for tile flipping.

This setup should reflect a simplistic puzzle mechanic, with the player flipping tiles back and forth to achieve the win condition.
