To create a simplified demake of "Time Trinkle," we need to focus on core mechanics that align with its concept: manipulating time by flipping tiles forward or backward to solve puzzles. The goal is to restore tiles to their correct state to win.

### Plan:

1. **Objective**: Create a PuzzleScript game where the player can flip tiles that represent time states (e.g., past or future). The objective is to return all tiles to a specific state considered "correct" (perhaps future).

2. **Game Elements**:
   - **Player**: An entity which moves around and interacts with tiles.
   - **Tiles**: Objects with states (e.g., Past and Future).
   - **Correct State**: Tiles flipped to Future to solve the puzzle.
   - **Transition**: Player interacts with tiles to change their state.

3. **Visual Design**: Utilize distinct colors to differentiate between tile states and the player.

4. **Rules**:
   - Player can move in four directions.
   - Interacting with a tile flips its state.
   - The game is won when all tiles are in the Future state.

5. **Levels and Win Condition**: Create a basic level where all 'Past' tiles need to be flipped to 'Future' to win.

Here is the code for the game:

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Title Section**: Sets the title, author, and homepage of the game.
- **Objects Section**: Defines different game elements: Background, Player, PastTile, FutureTile with specified colors.
- **Legend Section**: Represents how various objects are simplified in the code, e.g., Background, Player.
- **Sounds Section**: Placeholder with a flip sound for tile interaction.
- **Collision Layers**: Sets object interaction layers, ensuring they overlap appropriately.
- **Rules Section**: Defines how player interactions change tile states, toggling between PastTile and FutureTile.
- **Win Conditions**: Establishes the game-winning condition as all tiles being in their Future state.
- **Levels Section**: Composes a basic level layout with instructions.

This demake captures the essence of manipulating time states on tiles within a puzzle framework, aligning with the game's concept.
