To address the issue in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to fix the sprite definition for the Player object. The error suggests that the Player object attempts to reference multiple colors when only one is defined. Let's resolve this by defining the Player's graphic with a single color and adjusting the ASCII art accordingly. Additionally, ensure the entire game functions as intended to simulate the concept of flipping tiles to restore the future state.

Here is the revised game code:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Player Sprite Fix:** The previous Player sprite attempted to utilize multiple colors but only had one defined. This has been fixed by reducing the sprite to the single color available, Pink, creating a simplistic graphic with clear visibility.
- **Consistency Check:** Verified all other components such as collisions, rules, and win conditions to ensure they follow the game narrative and mechanics described. 

This code should now compile correctly in PuzzleScript, providing a simplified version of the game concept while maintaining the core idea of flipping tiles to alter their state.
