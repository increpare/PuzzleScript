(For making maps easily: uncomment out the next few lines + press action to discard all boundaries and recreate them)

( up [ action player ] [ Crate | Crate ] -> [ action player ] [ Crate Crate_u | Crate Crate_d ] )
( right [ action player ] [ Crate | Crate ] -> [ action player ] [ Crate Crate_r | Crate Crate_l ] )

(Propagate movements within and between extended bodies)

+ up [ moving Crate Crate_U | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_U | moving Crate ]
+ down [ moving Crate Crate_D | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_D | moving Crate ]
+ left [ moving Crate Crate_L | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_L | moving Crate ]
+ right [ moving Crate Crate_R | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_R | moving Crate ]

(Move connections along with the crates themselves)
[ moving Crate stationary Crate_connection ] -> [ moving Crate moving Crate_connection ]

(If any crate can't move, cancel the turn. This works because there's only one player.)
[ > Crate | wall ] -> cancel

too many errors, aborting compilation
Errors detected during compilation; the game may not work correctly.
Return a repaired version of the code that addresses these errors. First, reason about your task and determine the best plan of action. Then, write your code.  The game should be a simplified `demake` of the following game idea: **Time Trinkle:** Manipulate time by flipping tiles forward or backward, solving paradox puzzles to restore history in a fractured world.. Return your code in full, inside a ```plaintext code block.
