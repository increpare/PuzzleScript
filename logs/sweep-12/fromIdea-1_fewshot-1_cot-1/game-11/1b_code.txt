To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to inspect the object definitions and their respective color palettes. The color palette definition for each sprite should include all the colors referenced in the sprite's bitmap. Let's break down the issues and resolve them step-by-step:

1. **Wall Object**: The error indicates that the Wall sprite is trying to access color number 1, but its palette only has one color defined. We should ensure the Wall has a palette with enough colors for all unique numbers used in its design. It seems the Wall just needs one solid color across its entire bitmap, so we can simplify its design:

   - **Current Design**: 
     - Two colors are defined (grey is repeated as the primary color).
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure the design uses the designated color accurately.

2. **Player Object**: Similarly to the Wall, the Player sprite is accessing an undefined color because the defined colors must include those represented by numbers in the design.

   - **Solution**: Ensure that there is a sufficient palette for all representations in its design.

3. **Additional Checks**: Confirm that all objects correctly use their color palette.

Letâ€™s update the code accordingly:

The changes include updating `Player`'s color palette to include an additional color and ensuring `Wall` had consistent use of its color scheme. This corrects the compilation errors and sets the game up to run as intended.
