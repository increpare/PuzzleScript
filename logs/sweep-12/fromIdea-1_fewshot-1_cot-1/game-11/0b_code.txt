To create a simplified `demake` of **Puzzlot** in PuzzleScript, we need to translate the core mechanics into a minimalist form suitable for the PuzzleScript environment. Here is a plan to achieve this:

1. **Design Concept**: Focus on logic puzzles in a labyrinth setting with treasures and traps. To achieve simplicity:
    - Use a grid-based room representing the labyrinth.
    - Incorporate simple puzzles involving moving boxes onto target spots to unlock treasures.
    - Use traps that block the player's path to enforce puzzle solving.
    - Room unlocks once the puzzle is solved.

2. **Objects**:
    - **Player**: The main character who navigates the labyrinth.
    - **Wall**: Blocks that define the room boundaries.
    - **Box**: Puzzle elements that need to be pushed onto targets.
    - **Target**: The spots where boxes should be placed.
    - **Treasure**: The reward for solving the puzzle.
    - **Trap**: Blocks that are removed when puzzle is solved.

3. **Win Conditions**:
    - All boxes must be placed on the targets. This unlocks traps and reveals treasures.

4. **Rules**:
    - Player can push boxes into empty spaces or onto targets.
    - When a box is placed on a target, it becomes stationary until moved off the target.
    - Once all targets hold a box, traps are removed and treasures are accessible.

5. **Levels**:
    - Design a few starting levels manually to illustrate the game mechanics.
    - Generate levels procedurally for added replayability using PuzzleScript's random behavior.

Following this plan, here is the complete PuzzleScript code for the game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: The game includes background, walls for boundaries, a player, moveable boxes, targets for puzzles, treasures as rewards, and traps that block passage.
- **Rules**: The player can push boxes. Boxes must be placed on targets to unlock traps (obstacles) and reveal treasures.
- **Win Condition**: The level is completed once all boxes are correctly positioned on targets.
- **Levels**: Two levels are provided as a demonstration, challenging the player to navigate and solve the puzzle to access treasures.

This implementation directly translates the core aspects of **Puzzlot** into a compact, grid-based PuzzleScript game with a focus on simple logic and rewards.
