**Reasoning:**

To create a simplified PuzzleScript demake of "Tile Tactics," the game's core mechanics should be captured in a condensed form. 

1. **Conceptualization:** The original game involves placing soldier tiles on a grid, using strategic positioning and terrain advantage to achieve victory. 
   
2. **Simplification:** In the PuzzleScript demake:
   - A grid will function as the battlefield.
   - Soldiers will be the primary movable pieces.
   - Both the player and AI will position soldiers.
   - Certain tiles might represent advantageous terrain for soldiers to win or lose against other soldier tiles.
   - Achieving a victory condition is crucial, such as occupying certain key positions or eliminating all opposing soldiers.

3. **Game Components:**
   - Grid: Represented with simple background tiles.
   - Soldiers: Different soldier types for mixed strategy. 
   - Terrain: Tiles with special properties impacting battles.

4. **Gameplay Mechanics:**
   - Players take turns placing soldiers. 
   - Winning condition: Have most soldiers on advantageous terrain or eliminate enemy soldiers.

5. **PuzzleScript Elements:**
   - Define objects for the background, soldiers, and terrain.
   - Write rules for placing soldiers and terrain effects.
   - Set up a basic winning condition.
   - Design simple levels to demonstrate mechanics.

**Explanation:**

- **Objects:** Define simple visuals for the background, player soldiers, enemy soldiers, and advantageous terrain.

- **Legend:** The legend assigns symbolic letters to each defined object for use in rules and levels.

- **Collision Layers:** Ensure distinct layers so that soldiers can interact with the environment and one another correctly.

- **Rules:**
  - Soldier placement is permitted.
  - Soldiers override enemy soldiers when moving onto their space.
  - Winning condition is by occupying advantageous terrain with a player soldier.

- **Levels:** A couple of example scenarios to illustrate the mechanics where one tile represents an advantageous terrain that must be occupied by player soldiers to win.

This simplified demake introduces the core strategic mechanics of positioning and domination within PuzzleScript's limitations.
