To address the compilation error, we need to ensure that there is a player object defined in the game code. In PuzzleScript, a player object must be explicitly identified in either the `OBJECTS` or `LEGEND` sections.

The error suggests that the game could not find an object called "player." In the current code, there is an object `PlayerSoldier`, but it is not designated as the player. To fix this, we need to map the player control to the `PlayerSoldier` object in the `LEGEND` section.

Here's how to fix the code:

1. Add an entry in the `LEGEND` section to denote that `PlayerSoldier` is the player:
   - The symbol `P` can map to `Player`, allowing the game engine to recognize `P` as the player object.

2. Ensure there are no syntax or semantic errors remaining after the modification.

Here's the revised code:

In this corrected version, `PlayerSoldier` is explicitly designated as the player using the `@` symbol in the `LEGEND` section. Now the engine recognizes `P` (marked by `@`) as the player's object, resolving the initial error. This should enable the game to compile and run correctly.
