To address the error mentioned in the console output, we need to ensure that each rule's left-hand side pattern (LHS) has a corresponding right-hand side pattern (RHS) of equal length in terms of number of cells. The error is likely due to mismatched rule patterns where the LHS doesnâ€™t correspond correctly to the RHS. 

Reviewing the rules section, one potential issue is with the lines:
```plaintext
[ Box | Target ] -> [ BoxOnTarget | Background ]
[ BoxOnTarget | Background ] -> [ Box | Background ]
```
These are correct as they stand because they maintain symmetry in cells. However, the rules:
```plaintext
[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box ]
```
Here, the rule doesn't specify a cell on the RHS for each cell on the LHS. We need to rewrite it to ensure both sides have an equal pattern length. 

Upon investigation, there seems to be no single cell pattern to match against another, so I realized the rule isn't necessary because it's indirectly handled by other rules. 

Now, let's return a fixed version of the code:

I removed the redundant rule `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box ]` since it was neither symmetrical nor necessary with the rules present. This resolves the mismatch because each rule now properly transfers a state from LHS to RHS with corresponding cells.
