The error messages you're encountering suggest there are several problems with your level definitions:
1. The semicolon (`;`) is not needed and causes errors as it is not part of the PuzzleScript syntax for defining levels, nor is it defined in the legend.
2. The lines indicating "Level 1", "Level 2", etc., cannot be interpreted because they are not part of PuzzleScript syntax and are recognized as object keys.
3. Each level map must be rectangular, meaning each line must have the same length.

Given these issues, we need to remove the comments that are not compatible with PuzzleScript and ensure each level board has equal row and column lengths where necessary.

Here's the revised code:

### Explanation:
- Removed all semicolons and descriptions that were causing errors.
- Validated that each map rows are of equal length to maintain a rectangular shape. Upon inspection, they were already correct here, but ensuring no previous changes were made to their dimensions just in case.
