The error messages indicate that there's an issue with the color definition for the `BoxOnTarget` object. PuzzleScript expects that the color specified is predefined or correctly defined within its color palette. The predefined colors include basic names like red, green, blue, etc., and the color `olive` doesn't seem to be part of this set. 

To fix this issue, we can replace `olive` with one of the standard color names that PuzzleScript recognizes. Additionally, we need to ensure the color palette is correctly defined for `BoxOnTarget`. Let's choose a different available color, such as `darkgreen`, to replace `olive`. 

Here's the repaired version of the code:

By changing the color of `BoxOnTarget` to `darkgreen`, a likely recognized color in PuzzleScript, this should address the original compilation errors, allowing the game to function as intended.
