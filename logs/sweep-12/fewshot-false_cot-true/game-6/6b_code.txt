The errors in the original PuzzleScript game code are due to several common issues. Below is a breakdown of the problems and the necessary steps to fix them:

1. **Object Sprites Issue**: Each object's sprite needs to be exactly 5x5 pixels, but in the submitted code, they're just five lines with no content. These representations need placeholders (e.g., a dot to use as a placeholder).

2. **Legend Syntax Problem**: The legend entries were not formatted correctly. The correct format is to define each symbol representing an object using the equals sign.

3. **Order of Sections**: The COLLISIONLAYERS section is ordered to come after SOUNDS, or if there’s no SOUND section to be included, indicate this with an empty SOUNDS header.

4. **Rules and Case Sensitivity**: You should adhere to using the correct object names as they are defined, and remember PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. Ensure that names referenced in rules, win conditions, etc., match those defined in the OBJECTS section.

5. **Extraneous Characters**: Some errors were caused by unnecessary dashes that were used to denote section separations. Stick to simple section titles.

With these insights, let’s correct the code:

Key changes made:
- Provided proper placeholding sprites for each object.
- Fixed the legend syntax to ensure proper mapping.
- Added the SOUNDS section as a placeholder to maintain order before COLLISIONLAYERS.
- Corrected capitalizations and ensured the rule references correspond to correct object names.
