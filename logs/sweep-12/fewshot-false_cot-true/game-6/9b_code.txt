To address the compilation errors in the PuzzleScript game code provided, we need to make several corrections:

1. **Line 60 Error**: The error message indicates that anything after a line of `===` should be a comment. We should make sure no unintended content follows these symbolic lines, but it seems this part of the error might just be a misunderstanding caused by combined errors elsewhere rather than an actual issue on this line. We'll focus on fixing the actual issues related to code structure.

2. **Line 80 Error**: This error indicates that the space (`" "`) is used in the map but is not properly defined in the legend. It is intended to be a shortcut for the `Background` object, which is denoted by `.`, but this wasn't secured properly. We should either replace spaces in the map with `.` or explicitly specify that spaces represent `Background` in the `LEGEND`.

3. **Line 71 and 72 Errors**: The rule syntax errors suggest that the number of square-bracketed elements on each side of the arrow (`->`) should match. This involves ensuring consistency when updating states in the rule definitions.

4. **TypeError: row_l is undefined**: This error may stem from incorrect or unbalanced brackets or rows in the level definition that leads to improper parsing of the rows.

To correct these issues, we'll make the following changes:
- Adjust the `LEGEND` to ensure empty spaces represent the `Background`.
- Correct the rules to balance the left and right sides.
- Ensure that the level representation adheres to correct map structure.

Here is the corrected code:

The above adjustments should address the errors by clarifying the map symbol usage and ensuring rule syntax correctness. Note the important element of matching brackets in rules and the addition of Background as a mapped space in the legend to ensure proper recognition of empty spaces in the map.
