To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address each issue reported in the console output.

1. **Line 60:** The error states that "Only comments should go after a bunch of equals signs ('===') on a line." In this case, there are extra equals lines (===) inside the console output error section which shouldn't appear in the code. We can safely ignore this error as it is not part of the code, but part of the problem description.

2. **Line 80:** The error mentions that symbol " " (space) used in the map is not found. The space should be defined in the `LEGEND` section as `Background`, since we are already using that symbol with 'Background'.

3. **Line 71 and Line 72:** There are errors referring to mismatched rule patterns. Every time a rule has `->`, the number of elements on the left and right should match. We'll have to adjust the rules to ensure that the patterns on both sides are consistent in quantity.

4. **Line 74:** Similar to lines 71 and 72 errors, the defined rules have mismatches in the number of patterns or cells and their respective targets. We'll adjust these rules too, focusing on matching the pattern sizes appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the given PuzzleScript game code:

Explanation of Fixes:
- Defined a space character ' ' as `Background` in the `LEGEND`.
- Adjusted the rules to ensure the LHS and RHS of each rule have the same number of patterns (`[ | Player ]` combined correctly with its counterpart).
- Maintained the collision layers order and other constructs according to PuzzleScript syntax to ensure objects interact as intended.
