The issues in the provided PuzzleScript code stem from the use of incorrect syntax for the pixel art within the OBJECTS section. In PuzzleScript, the pixel art should follow the name of the object directly, without describing its colors second or misusing pixel art lines. Additionally, each object definition is missing a requirement to include the color directly after the object name before starting the 5x5 pixel art grid.

To fix these issues, I will adhere to the proper format: after declaring an object, specify its color and then include a 5x5 grid of 0s and 1s to represent its design. Correcting these errors will resolve the compilation issue. Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Changes Made:
- Added a 5x5 pixel grid for each object using '.' as a filler outside shapes, ensuring clarity within the pixel art blocks.
- Ensured objects have a color specified right before the pixel art.
- Maintained logical and layout correctness while following the syntax rules of PuzzleScript.
