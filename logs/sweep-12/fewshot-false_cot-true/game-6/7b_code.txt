To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's analyze each issue step by step:

1. **Error on Line 79: "Error, symbol ' ', used in map, not found."**
   - This error indicates that there is a space character in the LEVELS section that is not defined in the OBJECTS or LEGEND sections. In the LEGEND section, we should include a mapping for the space character to the Background object, which will solve this issue.

2. **Errors on Lines 70, 71, and 73: Related to rule match length inconsistencies.**
   - The rules on lines 70 and 71 are incorrectly formatted. PuzzleScript requires the same number of cells on both sides of the rule.
   - The first rule `[ Player | Box ] -> [ Player | ] [ Box ]` should imply that the Player moves into the Box's position, and the Box moves forward. The correct format should ensure the movement logic is preserved, which means `[ Player | Box ] -> [ | Player ] [ Box | ]`.
   - The second rule `[ Player | BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Player | ] [ Box ]` indicates moving a Box that was on a Target. This rule can be resolved similarly, resulting in `[ Player | BoxOnTarget ] -> [ | Player ] [ Box | Target ]`.
   - The rule `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box | Target ]` should also ensure the conversion of BoxOnTarget back to Box when removed from the Target. The structure remains correct but should incorporate separate handling via `[ BoxOnTarget ] -> [ Box | Target ]`.

Now, let's rewrite the code with these corrections:
