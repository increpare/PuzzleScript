The errors in your PuzzleScript game code are primarily due to incorrect section headers and syntax issues. Let's go through the plan to address these problems:

1. **Section Headers**: In PuzzleScript, section headers must be specified using a single equals sign, not multiple ones. So, change `=====` to `=` for each header.

2. **Object Definitions**: Ensure that objects are correctly defined within their section. At present, the objects are correctly listed but use the incorrect section formatting.

3. **Alignment and spacing**: Ensure that all section headers and keywords align correctly with standard PuzzleScript formatting.

Here's the corrected code with these changes implemented:

= LEVELS =
# # # # # # #
# . . . . . #
# . B B T . #
# . . P . . #
# T . . . . #

```

This corrected code should now be free of the syntax errors that were causing the compilation to fail.
