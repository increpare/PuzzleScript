To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to pay attention to the following:

1. **Color and Formatting Errors:** The error messages suggest that there is a problem with the formatting of the colors specified for the objects. In PuzzleScript, colors should be written in a single line for each object. The format is `ObjectName CHAR R G B`.

2. **Object Definitions:** Ensure each object's definition correctly follows the pattern mentioned above. The parser has found conflicting uses of names like "0" and "255" due to the misformatting of object definitions.

3. **Align the Collision Layers:** Make sure the collision layers are appropriately listed, ensuring all object types are correctly assigned.

Next, let's address these issues and provide a corrected version of the code:

```

**Explanations:**
- Each object is now defined in one line with a clear syntax: `ObjectName CHAR R G B`.
- Make sure to replace `Player Samira` with `Player P` for simplicity and brevity in the syntax.
- Ensure that the collision layers now include the `Wall` as it appears in the level, even though there are no direct rules affecting it.
- The error messages are addressed by reformatting the color definitions and ensuring every property is appropriately aligned with the expected format.

This corrected version should now compile without errors.
