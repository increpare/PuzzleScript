produced the following console output:
=================================
line 4 : Unrecognised stuff in the prelude.
line 15 : Object "SAMIRA" defined multiple times.
line 16 : Was looking for color for object SAMIRA, got ". 0 0 255" instead.
line 17 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 18 : Name "120" already in use.
line 19 : Was looking for color for object T, got "x " instead.
line 19 : Was looking for color for object T, got "255 " instead.
