To repair the code, let's first understand the errors and find their causes:
1. **Name "10" already in use.**: This error occurs because the syntax for defining objects was not correctly followed. The format should be `ObjectName Character R G B`, which requires a single character (or string for multiple characters) to represent each object and its RGB color value.

2. **Several errors related to color definitions and invalid object color syntax.**: This is due to improper color and name declarations for objects. The correct way to define an object with a name, character, and color is crucial.

The correct syntax for defining objects in PuzzleScript should look like:
```
ObjectName SYMBOL R G B
```

To address these issues, let's correct the object definitions by assigning the correct symbols and syntax for each entry:

- Assign unique symbols for each type of object.
- Ensure each object is defined correctly with a unique character and RGB color.

Here is the corrected PuzzleScript code:

Summary of changes:
- Each object is defined with an appropriate symbol and its color.
- The symbol for `Box` is changed from `X` to `x` for consistency in lowercase representation.
- Reformatted and corrected the incorrect syntax to comply with the PuzzleScript language requirements.
