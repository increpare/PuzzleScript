To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to ensure that it includes the following key components:

1. **Objects**: Define the game objects that are visible on the screen.
2. **Legend**: Map the characters used in the level designs to the actual game objects.
3. **Sounds**: (Optional) Define any sounds used in the game.
4. **Collision Layers**: Specify how different objects interact with each other.
5. **Rules**: Write the rules that govern object interactions and player movements.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define when a player or level completes the game.
7. **Levels**: Create the layouts for different levels of the game.

For demonstration, I'll create a basic Sokoban-like game where the player pushes boxes to targets. Here's my plan:

1. **Objects** needed:
   - Player
   - Wall
   - Box
   - Target
   - Floor (background)

2. **Legend**: Map symbols to the objects for easy level referencing.

3. **Collision Layers**: Ensure objects like boxes, walls, and player have appropriate collision handling.

4. **Rules**: Define movement rules and what happens when pushing boxes.

5. **Win Conditions**: Game is won when all boxes are on targets.

6. **Levels**: Include a couple of simple levels for demonstration purposes.

Now, onto writing the game code in PuzzleScript language.

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined basic objects like walls, boxes, targets, and player with simple colors.
- **Legend**: Maps simple characters to these objects for easy level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Sets up layers so the player can move and push boxes, but can't move through walls.
- **Rules**: Allows the player to push boxes when next to them.
- **Win Conditions**: Player wins when all boxes are on the target.
- **Levels**: Provides two levels with different arrangements of walls, boxes, targets, and player starting positions.

This setup provides a straightforward yet functional PuzzleScript game.
