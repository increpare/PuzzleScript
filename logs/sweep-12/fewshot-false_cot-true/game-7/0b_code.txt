To create a PuzzleScript game, I need to define several key components: 

1. **Title & Author** - Basic metadata about the game.
2. **Legend** - Symbols representing game objects.
3. **Sounds** - Optional but can be included for a richer experience.
4. **Collision Layers** - Organization of objects into layers to prevent overlap issues.
5. **Rules** - Logics that define how objects interact or move.
6. **Win Conditions** – The objectives or conditions that determine the completion of a level.
7. **Levels** - Layouts that the player will navigate through.

For this example, I’ll create a simple Sokoban-like game where the player (represented by a "P") must push boxes ("B") onto target tiles ("T") to win. I'll focus on providing a straightforward and engaging puzzle experience.

Here is the complete PuzzleScript code for such a game:

```plaintext
=========
title Sokoban Simple
author YourName

=========
legend
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target
. = Floor
# = Wall

=========
sounds
# Player movement
moveP
    play sound "beep"

# Box being pushed
moveB
    play sound "thud"

# Box placed on target
moveB P T 
    play sound "chime"

=========

=========
rules
# Player movement
[ > Player | ] -> [> Player |]
[ < Player | ] -> [< Player |]
[ ^ Player | ] -> [^ Player |]
[ v Player | ] -> [v Player |]

# Push the box
[ > Player | Box ] -> [ > Player | > Box ]
[ < Player | Box ] -> [ < Player | < Box ]
[ ^ Player | Box ] -> [ ^ Player | ^ Box ]
[ v Player | Box ] -> [ v Player | v Box ]

=========
winconditions
All Box on Target

=========
levels

# Level 1
#########
#.......#
#..P....#
#...B...#
#...T...#
#########

# Level 2
#########
#..####.#
#..#....#
#..#BTP.#
#..#....#
#..####.#
#########
```

### Explanation
- **Title & Author**: Provides basic metadata.
- **Legend**: Defines symbols like `P` for Player, `B` for Box, etc.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensures players and boxes are on the same layer to allow interaction, while walls remain separate.
- **Rules**: Dictate player movement and how boxes can be pushed.
- **Win Conditions**: Require all boxes to be on targets.
- **Levels**: Provide layouts for the game. Starting level is simple to introduce concepts, later levels can increase in complexity.

This blueprint ensures a basic yet fully playable Sokoban-style game, suitable for expansion or modification.
