To tackle the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's break down the issues and address them one by one:

1. **Wall Object Definition:**
   - The Wall object has been defined with a 5x5 sprite using lowercase 'r', which is not standard for defining objects in PuzzleScript; uppercase 'R' is used for sprites. 
   - There seems to be erroneous capitalized string "RRRRR" multiple times, leading to misinterpretation.

2. **Player Object Definition:**
   - The issue "Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER" indicates that the sprite design is incorrect.
   - Adjust the sprite representation for consistency, especially ensuring that the player's sprite uses uppercase for the active parts.

With these corrections, here's the revised version of the code:

### Explanation:

- **Wall Definition:** Used `R` for the Wall object sprite instead of lowercase `r`.
- **Player Definition:** Used `B` for the parts that compose the Player object sprite to adhere to the uppercase convention.
- This correction resolves the compilation errors allowing the game to work as intended.
