The errors in the PuzzleScript game code are related to improper color definitions for various sprites. Each sprite's color needs to be defined correctly, using valid hexadecimal colors or named colors standardized within PuzzleScript. The errors occur because the sprite definitions incorrectly refer to non-existent indices in the palette, like `8`, `1`, and `2`.

Here's the plan to fix the code:
1. Correct the color specifications for the `Wall`, `Box`, `Target`, and `BoxOnTarget` sprites.
2. Ensure that the intended visual representation matches the correct color indices available within PuzzleScript.

Here's the repaired version of the code addressing the compilation issues:

In this code:
- Fixed the color references by using valid identifiers (i.e., `1`, `b`, `c`) instead of undefined palettes. Adjusted `Box`, `Target`, and `BoxOnTarget` with proper mappings.
- Ensured that a visual distinction is maintained between the sprites using different available shades.
