To repair the PuzzleScript code, I need to address several issues identified in the error messages. Here's the plan of action:

1. **Sprite Size**: PuzzleScript expects each sprite to be exactly 5 pixels by 5 pixels. The sprites in this code are currently mostly 4x4, so I will resize them to 5x5.

2. **Color Code Length**: The color codes in the `Wall` and `Box` objects aren't correctly interpreted due to improper length. I will fix their colors and sprite patterns to match the expected format.

3. **Correct Legends and Rules**: Ensure all objects in rules and legends correspond correctly to these resized and recolored objects.

Let's apply these steps to fix the code:

This version of the code should correctly adhere to PuzzleScript's requirements. Each sprite is now 5x5, ensuring compatibility with the system's expectations.
