To repair the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the errors related to sprite definitions for the objects. Specifically, PuzzleScript expects the color of each object to be defined on a single line followed directly by a sprite matrix using a combination of adjustable ASCII art characters, typically '.','x', or similar to denote spaces. Each sprite character corresponds both color (uppercase stands out for readability, but should not conflict with color names unless intended for specific purposes in the game) and shape in an ASCII art grid that forms the sprite.

Let's address these sprite-specific issues one by one:

1. **Wall Object Definition:**
   - The sprite definition for the `Wall` is incorrect. It should use a single-letter representation for each pixel in a 2D space instead of `.`
2. **Player Object Definition:**
   - Similar to the `Wall`, the sprite definition for the `Player` is using '.' which should be replaced with a valid letter like 'b'.
3. **Box and BoxOnTarget Definitions:**
   - They seem correctly defined, assuming the color designation matches.

Here's the corrected code:

In this corrected version, I've aligned the sprite matrices carefully for Wall, Player, etc., making sure both the structure matches syntax expectations and ensures visual consistency when rendered. Adjust any of these patterns with clarity or to better fit your visual needs within the defined constraints of tiled art.
