The errors in the PuzzleScript code arise due to incorrect sprite matrices specified for some objects. Each sprite matrix for an object should be a symmetrical grid representation, typically using one character per pixel, where all rows must be of equal length and represent the object's appearance. The colors should also be represented by left-aligned sprite characters as placeholders and be consistent in size across lines.

Let's break down the plan of action:

1. We'll analyze each object in the `OBJECTS` section to ensure that their sprite matrices use the same number of characters in each line. 
2. Fix the `Wall`, `Player`, and `BoxOnTarget` sprite definitions to adhere to these expectations:
   - `Wall`: Made the matrix a symmetrical rectangle.
   - `Player`: Ensured consistent and symmetrical representation.
   - `BoxOnTarget`: Simplified to meet and match a smaller grid, consistent with other objects.
3. Ensure all object and sprite definitions are correct and all other sections of the code are formatted properly.

Let's fix the code:

This updated code should compile without the previous sprite matrix errors.
