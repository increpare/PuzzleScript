To repair the code, we'll address the errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Wall Sprite Error**: The error message indicates that the color index "1" is used in the "Wall" sprite, but thereâ€™s only one color (`RED`). In PuzzleScript, the colors are defined by a single letter, such as '1' for the first color, but there seems to be a misunderstanding here because the wall sprite is using '1' for "RED". The error likely arises because of the misunderstanding of the "index" usage. In the context of the color reference, PuzzleScript uses letters like `a`, `b`, etc., for multiple colors. It's possible that our usage doesn't match the specs, but since only one color is defined for `Wall`, you must consider the single color usage.

2. **Target Sprite Error**: The 'c' values in the sprite grid for "Target" are unrecognized; same for the BoxOnTarget sprite grid. The color for `Target` is represented by the first letter of the defined color and should only use one character in the array to represent it.

The version will include fixes for potential errors regarding coloring styles in the sprite matrices for "Wall" and "Target".

Here is the corrected code:

These changes fix the sprite color definitions so that they match expectations regarding the use of a single known color for each object definition, correcting issues during parsing related to sprite colors.
