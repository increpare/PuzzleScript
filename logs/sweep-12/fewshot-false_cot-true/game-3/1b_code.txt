The provided PuzzleScript code is generating errors because the sprite images of the objects don't adhere to a valid format. Specifically, PuzzleScript requires objects to be defined using colors from the game's available palette rather than using characters like period (.), zero (0), one (1), and letters (L). 

To fix the errors, we'll:
1. Use the `Color` syntax to define each object's color after the object's name.
2. Replace the custom sprite patterns with 0 (zero) to indicate opaque pixels and use the space character to indicate transparent/blank areas.
3. Ensure the use of appropriate colors from the PuzzleScript palette for each object.

The original concepts (e.g., the color descriptions and sprite designs) will guide the new sprite definitions.

Here's the repaired code:
