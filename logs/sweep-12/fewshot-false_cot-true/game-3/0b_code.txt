To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to follow a structured approach. PuzzleScript games have specific components, which include:

1. **Objects**: Define all necessary game objects (sprites).
2. **Legend**: Map text names to the objects for use in levels.
3. **Sounds**: Define any sound effects (can be optional).
4. **Collision Layers**: Specify layers to control movement interactions.
5. **Rules**: Set up the rules that govern the game's mechanics.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define conditions to end a level successfully.
7. **Levels**: Design one or more levels that use the defined objects and rules.

### Plan for the Game:
- **Theme**: Create a simple Sokoban-style puzzle game where the player pushes crates onto targets.
- **Objects**: Player, Wall, Crate, Target.
- **Legend**: Create mappings for the objects.
- **Rules**: Allow player to move and push crates; crates cannot move through walls or other crates.
- **Win Conditions**: All crates are on the targets.
- **Levels**: Design a basic level that demonstrates the mechanics.

Now, let's write the code for this game following these steps:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: We've defined sprites for each important object using a simple ASCII art design in a colorful format (Background, Player, Wall, Crate, Target, and a transformation of a crate on a target).
- **Legend**: This provides shorthand references for each object.
- **Collision Layers**: Set up layers to handle the interaction; the player and crates occupy the same layer to enable interaction.
- **Rules**: 
  - Player can push crates.
  - Crates transform into `CrateOnTarget` upon reaching a target.
  - Reverting crates from `CrateOnTarget` back to regular crates when moved off targets.
- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when no regular crates remain, meaning all have been transformed to `CrateOnTarget`.
- **Levels**: A straightforward level to illustrate the gameplay where the player needs to push one crate onto a target.

This is a basic implementation to get the game mechanics started. You can build upon this by adding more rules, levels, and refining the win conditions for a complete game experience.
