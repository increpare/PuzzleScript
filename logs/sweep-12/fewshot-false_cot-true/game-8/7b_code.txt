Based on the error messages, it seems the problem is with the format of the `objects` section. The description after each object incorrectly extends beyond the color specification, confusing the parser. In PuzzleScript, the correct format for each object in the `objects` section is:

`Name symbol color` 

Brief details or descriptions cannot follow the color directly and should instead be given in comments if needed. Let's correct these errors without extra information following the color.

Here's the revised and corrected version of the code:

I've removed the additional information from the lines defining the `objects` in your code. It should now parse correctly and function as expected.
