To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll first identify a simple game concept that can be effectively implemented within the constraints of the PuzzleScript language. PuzzleScript is well-suited for creating grid-based puzzle games with simple mechanics and rules. A classic example is a sokoban-style game where the player pushes blocks onto target tiles.

### Plan
1. **Concept Selection**: I'll create a sokoban-style game where the player moves boxes onto target areas.
2. **Define Objects**: I'll need objects like player, wall, box, target, and floor.
3. **Define Legend**: Assign characters for objects that will be used in levels.
4. **Define Sounds**: Use simple sound cues for actions like moving, winning, etc.
5. **Implement Rules**: Rules translate player input into game actions, allowing movement and interaction.
6. **Levels**: Design simple levels demonstrating game mechanics.
7. **Win Condition**: Define winning criteria, such as all boxes on targets.

### Code
Below is a complete PuzzleScript game implementing the sokoban concept:

### Explanation
- **Objects**: Define game components with colors.
- **Legend**: Use single-character symbols for each game object.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensure objects interact appropriately by layering them.
- **Rules**: Specify behavior, like player movement and box interactions.
- **Win Conditions**: Game is won when all boxes are on targets.
- **Levels**: Provide initial setups for gameplay.

This code sets a strong foundation for a sokoban-style game with PuzzleScript. You can extend it with more complex mechanics or levels if desired.
