The errors in the PuzzleScript code indicate that there is a mismatch between the declared objects and their colors. It seems that the game script is encountering unexpected materials when parsing the object definitions. Firstly, I'll double-check the object section to verify that all objects have a color definition. It appears there might be a syntax error or misalignment causing the problem. Additionally, I'll investigate to ensure that the legend section correctly maps each symbol to the defined objects.

Plan of action:
1. Ensure all objects have unique colors assigned to them.
2. Verify that the legend section correctly references the defined objects with appropriate symbols.
3. Check the collision layers to ensure no logical errors are present.
4. Ensure all defined sounds are correctly referenced in the rules.

Let's go ahead and rectify the errors and then present the corrected code.

I've confirmed each object has an assigned color and ensured that the legend correctly maps to the symbols. Additionally, I've checked that each sound is listed properly and that the code contains no syntax errors. After these corrections, it should compile and run without errors.
