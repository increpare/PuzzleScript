The errors in the PuzzleScript game code stem from the incorrect definition of graphical representations for the game objects. In PuzzleScript, graphical representations need to be enclosed within double quotes if they're defined as multi-line sprites. The code doesn't do this, resulting in errors.

To fix the issues, I'll modify the game objects' graphics to adhere to the correct syntax. Here's what I will do:

1. Enclose each multi-line sprite with double quotes.
2. Ensure each object is properly defined with a graphical representation that's valid in PuzzleScript language.

Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code:

```plaintext
Title: Simple Sokoban

# OBJECTS
Background
".....
.....
.....
.....
....."

Player
".000.
05550
05.50
05550
.000."

Wall
"11111
11111
11111
11111
11111"

Box
".333.
35553
35553
35553
.333."

Target
".....
..4..
.....
..4..
....."

# LEGEND
= Background
P = Player
W = Wall
B = Box
T = Target

# WINCONDITIONS
All Box on Target

# RULES
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player > Box]
[Target | Box] -> [Target]
[Target Box] -> [Target Box]

# COLLISIONLAYERS

# LEVELS

# Level 2

#P..T.#

########

# Level 3

#P....#
###B..#
#..T..#

#..T..#
#######

# Level 4
########
#P..#..#
#..BT..#
#..###.#
#..###.#
#...T..#
########
```

Now, each game's object definition that includes a graphic representation is properly formatted with quotes. This should resolve the compilation errors and allow the game to function correctly.
