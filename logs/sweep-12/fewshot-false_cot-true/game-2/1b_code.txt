The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the object definition section. Upon closer examination, I can see that there are semicolons and equal signs used for section headings, which do not align with the expected syntax for the PuzzleScript language. In the PuzzleScript language, sections are defined with simple headings without any special characters.

To resolve this, I will modify the section headings by removing any semicolons and equal signs. Additionally, I will fix the syntax for object icon definitions and collisions where necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the code with the errors addressed:

Key changes:
- Removed semicolons and equal signs from section titles to align with PuzzleScript section syntax.
- Revamped win condition format to fit the expected 'All Box on Target' format.
- Simplified rules to match the expected syntax, particularly around states of target and box.
- Corrected collision layers in accordance with defined objects.

Now, the code should compile without errors.
