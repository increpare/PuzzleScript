To successfully fix the PuzzleScript code, let's first go through the errors and see what adjustments are needed:

1. **Prelude Errors:** The error messages indicate issues in the prelude section, which includes the title and object definitions. PuzzleScript reserves a specific order and structure for the prelude, particularly for section headers.

2. **Objects Section:** Each object listed under `[Objects]` should have a corresponding single-line definition that maps a symbol to the object name followed by specifying the character representation.

3. **CollisionLayers:** Ensure all game objects are properly assigned in collision or movement layers.

4. **Win Conditions:** Ensure it correctly identifies the condition of winning, which looks correct here.

Let's repair the game code by following these insights:

[WinConditions]

```

### Changes Made:
- Added `Player and Goal` with `PG` and `Box and Goal` with `BG` in the `[Objects]` section to ensure dual state representations are explicitly defined.
- Verified prelude structure alignments especially in defining objects with their characters for proper parsing.
- Ensured all objects and their compound states were accounted for in rules and winning conditions.

This should alleviate the errors encountered and facilitate proper functioning of this simple Sokoban-style game in PuzzleScript.
