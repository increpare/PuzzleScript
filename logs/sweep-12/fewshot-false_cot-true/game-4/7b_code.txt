The errors in the provided code mainly stem from incorrect placement and definitions within sections. In PuzzleScript, objects and their interactions such as PlayerOnGoal and BoxOnGoal should be defined differently. Additionally, other sections must adhere to specific format guidelines. Let's address these issues:

1. **Objects Section:** The definitions of `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal` within `[Objects]` should actually be composite definitions properly introduced in `[Legend]`.

2. **Legend Section:** Aggregate the `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal` symbols here, where composites are correctly defined (combining multiple objects).

3. **CollisionLayers Section:** Ensure that the order and grouping of objects follow the game's interaction logic. Background and Goal were previously misplaced causing overlapping issues.

4. **Rules Section:** Ensure rules properly reflect state changes as composite objects like `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal` are indeed recognized.

5. **Level Layout Errors:** Ensure that all objects have been accounted for and placed correctly within levels.

Here is the corrected code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Simple Sokoban

[Objects]
Background . 
Wall #
Player P
Box B
Goal G

[Legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal
PG = Player and Goal
BG = Box and Goal

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Wall
Goal, Player, Box

[Rules]
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | Goal ] -> [ Player and Goal ]
[ Box | Goal ] -> [ Box and Goal ]
[ Player and Goal | Goal ] -> [ Player | Goal ]
[ Box and Goal | Goal ] -> [ Box | Goal ]

[WinConditions]
All Box and Goal

[Levels]
#####
#...#
#.#.#
#PB #
#####
```

This reformatted code should resolve parsing errors, by correctly defining composite objects in the `[Legend]`, arranging the layer logic in `[CollisionLayers]`, and updating interaction rules in `[Rules]` ensuring smooth transitions between game states.
