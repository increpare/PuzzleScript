To address the errors in the original PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the issues and make the necessary corrections:

1. **Title and Author Section**: PuzzleScript doesn't require explicit `Title` and `Author` sections, so these should be removed.

2. **Palette**: The color codes in `Palette` are supposed to be standard hex color codes, which is fine in this case, but PuzzleScript itself doesn't use a `Palette` section. The colors should be set directly within the `Legend`.

3. **Sounds Section**: PuzzleScript doesn't support a `Sounds` section natively. Remove this section entirely from the code.

4. **Rules section**: In the `[Rules]` section, ensure proper usage of rule syntax. The rules are correctly formatted.

5. **Goal with `PlayerOnGoal`**: There is no definition of `PlayerOnGoal`. It needs to be defined in the `Legend`.

6. **Boxes and Goals**: Similar issue with `BoxOnGoal`. Writing a rule but not defining the combination objects will cause issues.

Following these observations, hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```plaintext
[Legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal
PlayerOnGoal = Player Goal
BoxOnGoal = Box Goal

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Goal
Player, Box
Wall

[Rules]
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[Player | Goal] -> [PlayerOnGoal]
[Box | Goal] -> [BoxOnGoal]

[WinConditions]
All [BoxOnGoal]

[Levels]
#####
#...#
#.#.#
#PB #
##### 
```

**Revisions:**
- Removed `Title`, `Author`, `Palette`, `Sounds` sections as they are not part of the standard PuzzleScript syntax.
- Added definitions for `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal` in the `Legend`.
- Adjusted the `[CollisionLayers]` so that `Goal` is properly placed earlier in the layer order to interact correctly with `Player` and `Box` layer transforms. 

This code should compile without errors and run as intended.
