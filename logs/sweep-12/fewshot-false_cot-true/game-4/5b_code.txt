The error messages indicate issues with the sections defined in the game code. In PuzzleScript, sections need to be labeled with square brackets, such as `[title]`, `[legend]`, etc., and must be followed by a colon when speaking about entities. In this case, the code seems to be missing the initial and proper declarations that link entities to characters and to each other. Moreover, the section titles are known to be incorrectly placed as there are no spaces required after the square brackets. Let's address those errors by making sure each part is properly formatted according to PuzzleScript standards.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Simple Sokoban

[Legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal
PlayerOnGoal = Player G
BoxOnGoal = Box G

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Wall
Goal
Player, Box

[Rules]
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | G ] -> [ PlayerOnGoal ]
[ Box | G ] -> [ BoxOnGoal ]
[ PlayerOnGoal | G ] -> [ Player | G ]
[ BoxOnGoal | G ] -> [ Box | G ]

[WinConditions]
All BoxOnGoal

[Levels]
#####
#...#
#.#.#
#PB #
#####
```

In summary, make sure the section titles are not capitalized and formatted correctly, and check that each of the elements under each section is correctly defined. Additionally, ensure there's a consistent format without unnecessary whitespace or errors in keywords.
