To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, we need to focus on two main issues highlighted by the console output:

1. **Color Definition Error:** 
   - The error message indicates an issue with the color definitions for the `Crate` object. Specifically, `darkorange` should be written in camel case as `DarkOrange` to match with the defined color names, reflecting consistent syntax when declaring the colors in other objects.

2. **Level Rectangularity Error:**
   - The levels must be rectangular, meaning each row in a level must have the same number of characters.
   - The third level (`#..O.*..#` contains 7 characters instead of 9): it seems this row and the previous one should include a longer wall construction.

With these issues in mind, here is the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation:

- **Color Fix:** The color `darkorange` is now correctly capitalized as `DarkOrange` within the `Crate` object to ensure consistency with other object definitions. This corrects the error with palette misrecognition.
  
- **Level Rectangularity Fix:** Adjusted the third level to make sure each row has a consistent length of 9 characters, adding appropriate wall characters to align with the other levels in the game.
