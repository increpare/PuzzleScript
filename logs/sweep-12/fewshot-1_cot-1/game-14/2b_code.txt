To address the errors in the code, I've identified the following issues:

1. **Crate Sprite Definition Errors**: The error messages indicate that the `Crate` object is trying to access colors in its design that aren't defined. Each number in the sprite design should correspond to a color defined in the object's color list. `Crate` should have as many colors defined as numbers used in its sprite.

2. **Win Condition Definition Error**: The error in line 57 regarding the use of the 'ON' keyword suggests that the syntax for defining winning conditions was not correct.

To fix these issues, we need:

- **For the Crate Definition**: Adjust the color definition for `Crate` to match the number of required colors. Since we have four different numbers in the pattern (0, 1, and 2, implying three colors), we need to define a third color in the `Crate` object.
  
- **Proper Legend and Wincondition Definition**: Correctly format `@` in the legend to mean "Crate on Target". The `Win Conditions` should ensure all `Crate` instances are on `Target`.

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Crate Colors**: Added a second color `DarkOrange` to complement the use of numbers '0', '1', and '2' in the `Crate` sprite definition.
  
- **Legend Fix for `@`**: Corrected the legend entry for `@` to be `Crate and Target`, which reflects a crate on a target spot.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors and result in the game functioning correctly.
