To repair the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the issues regarding the color palettes for the `Wall` and `Player` objects. Both objects specify a color palette with only one color, yet their sprite definitions expect multiple colors. Specifically:

1. The `Wall` object specifies a single color (Grey), but its sprite definition references multiple colors (through 1's) which require a color palette with multiple colors.
2. The `Player` object specifies a single color (Yellow), but its sprite definition references multiple colors (through numbers 0-3) which require a color palette with multiple colors.

To resolve these errors, we need to adjust the color palettes to match the expectations set by their sprite definitions.

Here's a repaired version of the code:

Changes made:

- Added a second color (`DarkGrey`) to the `Wall` object to provide a two-color palette that the sprite definition can reference.
- Added three additional colors (`Black`, `White`, `Blue`) to the `Player` object, giving the sprite definition a palette of four colors to appropriately match numbers 0-3 used in the sprite definition.
