RULES
======
[Saved] [Wall] -> [] [Wall HasSaved] (Remembering whether we saved someone last round by attaching a note to some wall.)

[Corpse] -> Restart

(Adds a DidNotMove to where the player currently is, to cancel moves where they bump into a wall.)

[Player] -> [Player DidNotMove]

[ >  Fighter | Moveable ] -> [  >  Fighter | > Moveable  ]
[ > Moveable | Moveable ] [ Fighter] -> [ > Moveable | > Moveable ] [ Fighter] (Fighters push.)

[ < Thief | Moveable ] -> [ < Thief | < Moveable ] (Thieves pull.)

[ > Wizard ] -> [ Wizard > Warpball]
[ > Warpball | no Moveable no Static] -> [ | > Warpball]
[ > Warpball | Static] [Wizard] -> [ | Static ] [> Wizard]
[ > Warpball | Moveable ] [Wizard] -> [ | Wizard Sfx0] [Moveable] (Wizards telexport. What they really do is shoot a "warpball", which causes them to move normally if it hits a wall and warp if it hits something they can warp with.)

(The following mess is for changing characters.)
[ Action Fighter] [SThief] -> [SFighter] [Thief Sfx1]
[ Action Thief] [SWizard] -> [SThief] [Wizard Sfx1]
[ Action Wizard] [SPriest] -> [SWizard] [Priest Sfx1]
[ Action Priest] [SFighter] -> [SPriest] [Fighter Sfx1]

[ Action Fighter] [no SThief] [SWizard] -> [SFighter] [no SThief] [Wizard Sfx1]
[ Action Thief] [no Swizard] [SPriest] -> [SThief] [no SWizard] [Priest Sfx1]
[ Action Wizard] [no SPriest] [SFighter] -> [SWizard] [no SPriest] [Fighter Sfx1]
[ Action Priest] [no SFighter] [SThief] -> [SPriest] [no SFighter] [Thief Sfx1]

[ Action Fighter] [no SThief] [no SWizard] [SPriest] -> [SFighter] [no SThief] [no SWizard] [Priest Sfx1]
[ Action Thief] [no SWizard] [no SPriest] [SFighter] -> [SThief] [no SWizard] [no SPriest] [Fighter Sfx1]
[ Action Wizard] [no SPriest] [no SFighter] [SThief] -> [SWizard] [no SPriest] [no SFighter] [Thief Sfx1]
[ Action Priest] [no SFighter] [no SThief] [SWizard] -> [SPriest] [no SFighter] [no SThief] [Wizard Sfx1]

(Cancels the move if the player is in the same place that they started. Notice that switching characters negates this. Only matters in levels where one dragon has multiple targets.)

Late [Player DidNotMove] -> Cancel
Late [DidNotMove] -> []

(Now enemies attack.)

Late [DragonLeft] -> [LFireball DragonLeft]
Late [DragonRight] -> [RFireball DragonRight]

Late RIGHT [RFireball | No Vulnerable no Invulnerable] -> [ | RFireball]
Late LEFT [LFireball | No Vulnerable no Invulnerable] -> [ | LFireball]
Late RIGHT [RFireball | Vulnerable] -> [ | Dying Vulnerable]
Late Right [RFireball | Invulnerable] -> [ | Invulnerable]
Late Left [LFireball | Vulnerable] -> [ | Dying Vulnerable]
Late LEFT [LFireball | Invulnerable] -> [ | Invulnerable]

Late [Goblin | Vulnerable] -> [Goblin | Dying Vulnerable]

(Vulnerable objects that are attacked are designated as "Dying", but heroes can be saved by the Priest. Then the stuff that didn't get saved dies.)

Late [Dying Healer] -> [Saved Healer]
Late [Healer | Dying Hero] -> [Healer | Saved Hero]
Late [Dying Monster] -> [Sfx5]
Late [Dying Hero] -> [Corpse Sfx6]

(Doors opening.)

late [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor] -> [Weighing  YellowSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [YellowOpen] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor sfx2]
late [YellowSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowSwitch] [YellowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [YellowOpen sfx3]

late [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor] -> [Weighing PurpleSwitch] [ShadowDoor]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [PurpleOpen] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor sfx2]
late [PurpleSwitch no Weighing] [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleSwitch] [PurpleDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [PurpleOpen sfx3]

late [MonsterDoor] -> [ShadowDoor]
late [ShadowDoor] [Monster] -> [MonsterDoor] [Monster]
late [ShadowDoor] -> [sfx3]

(Looks for a HasSaved on a wall and moves it to the Priest. Then, if someone was saved this turn, plays the sound only if the Priest doesn't have the HasSaved note. Finally, cleans that up.)

late [Wall HasSaved] [Healer] -> [Wall] [Healer HasSaved]
late [Saved] [Healer no HasSaved] -> [Saved sfx4] [Healer]
late [HasSaved] -> []

RULES     
======     

[ > player ] [ stationary shadow ] -> [ > player ] [ < shadow ]

( 1. Propagate movements forward )
[ > Mover | stationary Movable ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable  ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box    ] [ > Box    ]
+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate  ] [ > Crate  ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest  ] [ > Chest  ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 2. Propagate obstructions backwards )
[ > Mover  | stationary Obstacle ] -> [ stationary Mover | Obstacle ]
+ [ > Crate  ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ stationary Crate ] [ Crate ]
+ [ > Box    ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ stationary Box   ] [ Box   ]
+ [ > Chest  ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ stationary Chest ] [ Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ stationary Glue | Glue ]

( 3. remove all movement, keep a flag )
[ > Movable ] -> [ Movable wanna_move ]

( 4. propagate movement only on wanna_move things )
(    ie redo step 1 but with WANNA_MOVE added to the first line below )
[ > Mover  | stationary Movable WANNA_MOVE ] -> [ > Mover | > Movable ]
+ [ > Box   ] [ stationary Box   ] -> [ > Box   ] [ > Box   ]
+ [ > Crate ] [ stationary Crate ] -> [ > Crate ] [ > Crate ]
+ [ > Chest ] [ stationary Chest ] -> [ > Chest ] [ > Chest ]
+ [ moving Glue | stationary Glue ] -> [ moving Glue | moving Glue ]

( 5. cleanup, remove flag )
[ wanna_move ] -> [ ]
