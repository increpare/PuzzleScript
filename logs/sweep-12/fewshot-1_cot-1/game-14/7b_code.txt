The error in the console output indicates that the code is attempting to use a color index in the `Crate` object that does not exist in the defined color palette. The `Crate` object has been defined with only two colors: Orange and Brown. However, the sprite for the `Crate` references indices up to `2`, indicating that three unique colors are needed, but only two are provided.

To resolve this issue, I need to adjust the color indices in the `Crate` sprite to match the provided color palette. The problem can be addressed by changing the `222` and `2.2.` parts of the sprite to correspond to existing colors' indices. Since we want only two colors, both portions can be changed to an existing color index, either `0` or `1`.

Here is the corrected code:

In the corrected version, I replaced the `222` and `2.2.` in the `Crate` sprite with `000` and `0.0.` respectively, using the defined colors, thus resolving the error by aligning the sprite definitions with the palette size. This change ensures that the definitions follow the constraints specified in the game's object model, preventing out-of-bounds access errors in the sprite color definitions.
