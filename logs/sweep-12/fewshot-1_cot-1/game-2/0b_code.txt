When creating a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Title and Metadata**: We should define the game's title and author.

2. **Objects**: Define the different objects that will be used in the game, including the player, walls, background, and any interactive elements.

3. **Legend**: Create shorthand notations for game elements to simplify level design.

4. **Sound**: Define any sound effects that will be used in the game.

5. **Collision Layers**: Determine which objects can interact or collide with each other.

6. **Rules**: Implement the game's logic through rules that define what happens when objects interact or when various conditions are met.

7. **Win Conditions**: Define how the player can win the game or complete a level.

8. **Levels**: Design the levels of the game.

Here's a simple example of a game where the player must navigate a maze to reach a goal.

### Explanation:

1. **Title**: "Maze Explorer" â€“ This is a simple maze navigation game.
   
2. **Objects**: Includes `Background`, `Wall`, `Player`, and `Goal`. Each has a defined color and sprite.

3. **Legend**: Symbols are assigned for convenience in typing levels.

4. **Sound**: Sound assets are given placeholder IDs.

5. **Collision Layers**: Allows you to separate objects into different layers ensuring proper collision detection. `Player` can collide with `Wall`.

6. **Rules**: Simple rule specifying what happens when `Player` reaches the `Goal`.

7. **Win Conditions**: Declares when a level is won, i.e., when `Player` is on `Goal`.

8. **Levels**: A few simple labyrinth challenges are defined for the player to navigate.

This example should guide you on crafting a basic PuzzleScript game with clear components and rules. Adjust colors, sprites, and rules to create a unique experience.
