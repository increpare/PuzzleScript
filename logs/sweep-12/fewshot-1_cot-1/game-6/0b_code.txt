To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to determine the game's theme, mechanics, and goals. Here is a structured plan:

1. **Game Theme**: Let's make a game called "Alien Escape," where the player is an alien trying to collect energy orbs and escape through a portal to win.

2. **Objects**: We'll have the following objects:
   - `Background`: Basic tile for empty spaces.
   - `Alien`: The player character.
   - `Wall`: Impassable obstacles.
   - `EnergyOrb`: Collectible items.
   - `Portal`: The goal to reach after collecting all EnergyOrbs.
   - `ForceField`: Blocks passage until all EnergyOrbs are collected (it will disappear then).

3. **Mechanics**:
   - The player (Alien) moves around the level, collecting all EnergyOrbs.
   - Once all EnergyOrbs are collected, the ForceField disappears, allowing entry to the Portal.

4. **Sounds and Visuals**:
   - Unique designs for each object to make the game visually appealing.
   - Sound effects for collecting an orb.

5. **Win Conditions**: The level is completed when the player reaches the Portal after collecting all EnergyOrbs.

6. **Levels**: A few simple levels to demonstrate the game mechanics.

Here's the complete code for the game "Alien Escape":

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: The game contains a series of tiles representing walls, the player (Alien), orbs, a portal, and forcefields. 
- **Rules**: Players can collect orbs, and the forcefields only disappear once all orbs are collected, allowing the player to reach the portal.
- **Win Condition**: The player wins by standing on the Portal after collecting all EnergyOrbs.
- **Levels**: The levels demonstrate basic mechanics, with increasing complexity due to barriers and forcefields.
