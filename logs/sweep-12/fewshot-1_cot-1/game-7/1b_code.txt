To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, let's identify and fix each issue:

1. **Gold color name error:**  
   - PuzzleScript uses a specific set of colors, and "gold" is not one of them. We can replace "gold" with a similar color from PuzzleScript's palette like "yellow" or "orange". 

2. **Missing color definition for the Goal object:**  
   - The Goal object must have a color map defined in a grid format, even if it's a single dot.

3. **Misconfigured rule for endgame:**  
   - Instead of using an undefined "endgame" keyword, use a win condition and ensure the rule properly interacts with the win condition mechanism.

Here's the revised code:

```

In this corrected version:
- The "gold" color is replaced with "yellow".
- A simple pattern is defined for the Goal object.
- The rule invoking an end sound uses the `finish` sound label correctly. 
- The `finish` sound is played when the Player reaches the Goal. Additionally, the win condition is appropriately defined to end the game when the Player is on the Goal.
