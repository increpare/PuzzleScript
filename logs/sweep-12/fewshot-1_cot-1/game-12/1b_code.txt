To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to address two main problems:

1. **Color specification within the Wall sprite**: The errors indicate that the Wall sprite is attempting to access a color from the palette, but it has been defined with only one color (`Grey`). To fix this, we either need to change the sprite's pattern to use the single defined color or change the color palette to include more colors if needed.

2. **Color mismatch for BlockOnTarget**: The error for BlockOnTarget indicates that PuzzleScript is expecting a color name from the color palette, but got "Cyan" instead. In PuzzleScript, colors need to be specified using the color names defined in the system, not arbitrary capitalization or names.

Here's the revised code with these fixes:
- Correct the Wall definition to actually represent a single colored wall using the color we defined (`Grey`).
- Correct the color name "Cyan" to use an appropriate PuzzleScript color identifier, such as a specified color in the script or a predefined web color constant like `cyan`.

In this corrected code:
- The Wall sprite pattern now reflects a single grayscale color (`Grey`), addressing the access issue.
- The BlockOnTarget is now defined using a hex color code for cyan (`#00FFFF`), which is a standard color that PuzzleScript can interpret correctly.
