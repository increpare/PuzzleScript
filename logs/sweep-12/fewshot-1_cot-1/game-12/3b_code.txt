To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's analyze and fix them one by one:

1. **Color Palette Error for `BlockOnTarget`:** The error message suggests that the `BlockOnTarget` object is attempting to use colors in places where they aren't defined. This occurs because the colors are specified incorrectly. We need to ensure that the color code is formatted correctly. The colors should be defined as a space-separated list for outlines, fill, and other details.

2. **Sound Syntax Error:** There is a syntax error related to sound events. Even though there are no sound events defined in your code (`SOUNDS` section is empty), it seems there is an attempt to use a sound effect in the `RULES` section incorrectly. As there are no sound events needed here, any such references should be removed.

3. **Objects Outside Square Brackets in Rules:** The error suggests that there's an invalid placement of objects outside of square brackets in the rules section. This usually happens when trying to implement a movement rule where the object or direction code is placed incorrectly.

4. **Correct Logical Errors:** Review the rules logic for any array violations or incorrect logic representation to ensure smooth gameplay.

Here's the corrected code:

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed the color palette for `BlockOnTarget` by ensuring it has two distinct colors.
- Removed unnecessary references to sound actions in `RULES`.
- Ensured that each movement rule has appropriate syntax with square brackets and corrected positions.
- Assured logical formatting for the rules section.

This corrected code should compile without errors and have the intended gameplay mechanics.
