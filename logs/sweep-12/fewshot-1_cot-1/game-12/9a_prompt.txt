+ right [ moving Crate Crate_R | Crate ] -> [ moving Crate Crate_R | moving Crate ]

(Move connections along with the crates themselves)
[ moving Crate stationary Crate_connection ] -> [ moving Crate moving Crate_connection ]

(If any crate can't move, cancel the turn. This works because there's only one player.)
