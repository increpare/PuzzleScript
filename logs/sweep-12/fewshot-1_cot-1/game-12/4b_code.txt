To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to address the issues with the color definitions for the `BlockOnTarget` object. The error messages indicate that there's a problem with its color palette, specifically expecting more colors than what's defined.

Here's a step-by-step plan to address the problem:

1. **Correct the Color Definition for BlockOnTarget:**
   - Ensure that `BlockOnTarget` has a properly defined color palette with two colors as intended.

2. **Structure the Sprite Correctly:**
   - Ensure that both colors are correctly defined in the `BlockOnTarget` object.

Let's implement these changes in the corrected code block:

**Notes on the Correction:**
- The object `BlockOnTarget` now correctly uses the `Cyan White` colors. The gameplay logic in rule transformations and win conditions are maintained.
- If additional issues arise, further error messages will need to be examined for additional corrections.
