To fix the errors, let's evaluate the issues in the provided code:

1. **Line 79 Error**: This line is likely in the `SOUNDS` section. The error is caused because there are no sound events or sound conditions defined. If no sounds are needed, the section can be omitted entirely.

2. **Line 95 and 98 Errors**: It looks like the reported errors indicate misplacement of words like "moves" and "pushes". This may be due to text existing outside of the brackets in the `RULES` section. Ensure that rules are written properly with proper objects inside square brackets like `[ ]`.

3. **Line 101 Error**: The issue arises due to the incorrect placement of words "on". This could be due to misunderstanding of PuzzleScript syntax, which should have objects within square brackets, and each transformation rule should have a directional indicator and target configuration.

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation:
- **Removed the `SOUNDS` Section**: Since no sounds were defined, removing this section avoids possible confusion or errors.
- **Refactored Rules Section**: All rules must be within square brackets, following PuzzleScript syntax. Added Floor objects explicitly to ensure clarity of movement.
- **Ensured Proper Syntax**: Corrections were made to make sure directive verbs (`>` for movement) are used only with defined game objects.

With these corrections, this version of the code should compile and function without generating errors.
