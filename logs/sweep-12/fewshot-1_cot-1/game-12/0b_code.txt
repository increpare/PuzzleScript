To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to break down the game components and structure them properly according to the PuzzleScript language. Here are the key elements typically involved:

1. **Title and Metadata**: Defines the game's title, author, and any metadata.
2. **Objects**: Defines the visual and logical entities within the game.
3. **Legend**: Maps single characters to the objects defined.
4. **Sounds**: Adds sound effects, although they are optional.
5. **Collision Layers**: Sets up the logical layers for object interactions.
6. **Rules**: Defines the game's interactions and dynamics.
7. **Win Conditions**: Sets the conditions required to win a level.
8. **Levels**: Defines the layout and design of each level.

Let's create a simple PuzzleScript game where the player must push blocks to target areas, which could be similar to a Sokoban game but with a simplistic twist. I'll then provide the complete code.

### Game Plan:
- Title: Block Pusher
- Objective: Push all blocks onto target areas.
- Elements:
  - Player
  - Wall
  - Block
  - Target
  - Floor
- Rules: Player can push blocks into empty floor spaces. To win, all blocks must be on targets.

Now, let's write the code:

In this game, the player pushes blue blocks (B) onto green targets (T). Once all blocks are turned into 'BlockOnTarget' (X), the player wins the level. Adjust the levels as needed for difficulty or variety.
