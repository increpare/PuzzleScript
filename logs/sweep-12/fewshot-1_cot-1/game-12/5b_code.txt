To address the errors related to the `BlockOnTarget` object in the PuzzleScript game, we need to ensure that the color specifications are correctly defined. The error message indicates that there was an incorrect color definition for `BlockOnTarget`, specifically that "cyan " was used, but there was a space which caused it to be misinterpreted.

We'll fix this by ensuring that the colors for `BlockOnTarget` are properly defined with no extra spaces and with a standard color format. We'll also check the formatting of the color attributes for other objects to ensure there are no similar issues elsewhere.

Here's the corrected game code:

In this corrected version, we made sure not to have any extra spaces in the color definition for `BlockOnTarget`. This should resolve the compilation errors you encountered, allowing the game to work correctly.
