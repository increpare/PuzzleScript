The errors in the console output indicate a problem with the definition of the `BlockOnTarget` object, specifically regarding its color palette. The message "Was looking for color for object BLOCKONTARGET, got 'cyan' instead" suggests that the color "Cyan" wasn't recognized correctly. This could be due to a typo or the need for a more standard color specification.

Here's a plan to fix the issue:
1. Verify the color definition: Instead of using "Cyan," ensure you use a valid and correctly formatted color, typically a color code.
2. Double-check the structure of the `BlockOnTarget` object's definition.

Given that "Cyan" might be improperly recognized, we can replace it with its hexadecimal equivalent, `#00FFFF`.

Let's proceed with these fixes.

This corrected version uses a hexadecimal color code, which should be recognized correctly by the PuzzleScript compiler, addressing the errors related to the `BlockOnTarget` object.
