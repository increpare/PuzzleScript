The error messages in the console output indicate that there is a problem with the color specification for the `BlockOnTarget` object. The issue arises because a comment (`# Cyan color`) was added on the same line as the color declaration, which caused the interpreter to misinterpret it as a color value.

Here's the plan to fix these errors:
1. Remove the comment in the line specifying the color for `BlockOnTarget` and place it appropriately on a separate line or remove it completely.
2. Ensure there are exactly two colors specified for `BlockOnTarget` as intended.

Let's apply these corrections:
