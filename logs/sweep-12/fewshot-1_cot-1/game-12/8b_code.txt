The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code can be addressed with the following steps:

1. **Color Palette Error for BlockOnTarget**: The console output mentions an issue with accessing color numbers that are not defined in `BlockOnTarget`. We need to ensure that the sprite for `BlockOnTarget` uses valid color indices. Since the script uses a custom color, the indices should range from `.` (0) to `.` (0), hence the pattern needs to match the number of defined colors, which is one custom color in this case.

2. **Sound Definition Error**: The line that has the issue with sound events appears to be a place where sound events are expected but none are defined. Instead of commenting out the `SOUNDS` section, it can be left empty or removed if not used.

3. **Syntax Error with Rules**: The error indicates that there are syntax issues in the `RULES` section. Specifically, the line handling `BlockOnTarget` needs to move blocks in the same manner as `Block`. We will make sure all rule definitions conform to the PuzzleScript syntax rules. The rule `[ > Player | BlockOnTarget | Floor ] -> [ > Player | BlockOnTarget > ]` misses the correct alignment; let's fix this.

Here's the corrected version of the code, implementing these changes:
