The errors identified in the console output indicate that there is a problem with the color specification for the "BlockOnTarget" object. Specifically, it seems that the comment within the color definition string is causing confusion in the parsing process. Comments in color definitions are not allowed, and they lead to misinterpretation of the color palette.

To fix this issue, we need to redefine the color for "BlockOnTarget" without any inline comments. Additionally, ensure that the color definition follows the correct format: multiple colors should be separated by space if needed, but we need to ensure they're correctly defined.

Here's a plan of action:
1. Remove the inline comment in the color definition for "BlockOnTarget".
2. Use hexadecimal color codes or named colors correctly if necessary.

After applying these changes, the corrected code is as follows:

This change resolves the issue by correctly formatting the color declaration without any comments, ensuring the sprite is defined properly for "BlockOnTarget".
