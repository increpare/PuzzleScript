To address the console error regarding color access for the `Target` object, we need to ensure that the `Target` object has a properly defined pattern that includes multiple color indexes. The current code likely only defines a single color on the `Target` object's color palette, which causes the error when trying to access indices beyond what's available.

Here's the plan of action:

1. **Define a Proper Color Pattern for `Target`:** The error indicates that the `Target` object's current color pattern tries to access multiple colors, but only one is defined. We should redefine the `Target` object's color configuration to include multiple colors aligned with its 5x5 grid pattern.

Given the setup, a way to set this up appropriately is to use a combination of white and light green, ensuring that the inner pattern uses multiple indices to color it properly.

Let's update the code accordingly:

**Explanation:**

- The `Target` object is modified to have two colors: Black and LightGreen (`White LightGreen`) in its color palette.
- The grid pattern used for the `Target` object uses these colors appropriately to avoid accessing an undefined color index.
- The game's functionality and goal remain unchanged.
