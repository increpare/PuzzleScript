The errors in the game code need to be addressed one by one to ensure the game compiles correctly. Let's go through and resolve each issue:

1. **Color Palette Error for Target:**
   The `Target` object in the `OBJECTS` section is defined with just one color but attempts to use multiple colors. This needs to be corrected by defining an appropriate pattern with the correct number of colors.

2. **Section Order Error:**
   According to the error message, the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should follow the `SOUNDS` section. Even if `SOUNDS` is empty, it must still be present.

3. **Case Sensitivity Error:**
   PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. The error mentions a name "player" that does not exist, which implies that the rule is referring to "Player" but the case differs. Ensure that the object names are used consistently with regards to case.

Based on these errors and the explanations, here is the corrected PuzzleScript game code:

Changes made:
- Corrected the pattern in the `Target` object to properly correspond with the use of color indices.
- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section to comply with the requirement for section order.
- Corrected the name references to be case-sensitive by ensuring the `Player` object is consistently referred to as "Player".
