To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several components: objects, legends, sounds (if any), collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. Based on the examples provided, I will design a simple block-pushing puzzle game where the player needs to push crates onto targets.

### Game Design Plan:
1. **Objective**: The player, represented by 'Player', needs to push crates onto designated target tiles.
2. **Win Condition**: All crates should be on target tiles.
3. **Objects**: 
   - Background: The default background tile.
   - Player: The controllable character.
   - Crate: The movable object.
   - Target: The goal tile where crates need to be moved.
   - TargetedCrate: A crate on a target tile (this can be a combined state of Crate and Target).
4. **Colors**:
   - Background: Dark Gray
   - Player: Blue
   - Crate: Brown
   - Target: Yellow
   - TargetedCrate: Green (this will appear when a crate is on a target)
5. **Levels**: Designing simple levels that gradually increase in complexity.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code for this game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: I used basic colors to represent the background, player, crate, and target. A special object, `TargetedCrate`, visually differentiates when a crate is on a target.
- **Rules**: The player can push crates. When a crate is on a target, it automatically turns into a `TargetedCrate`, which is still moveable as a regular crate.
- **Win Conditions**: The game checks if all crates are properly placed on targets.
- **Levels**: Several levels are provided, starting simple and increasing in complexity. You'll need to push all crates onto targets to complete each level.
