The errors in the original PuzzleScript game code are related to the incorrect usage of color indices in the OBJECTS section. Specifically, the errors occur when defining the `Crate` and `Target` objects:

1. **Crate Object**: The code attempts to use color indices `1` for a sprite that likely has only one color defined. Puzzlescript expects the number of colors specified to match the number of indices used in the sprite's design.
   
2. **Target Object**: Similarly, the code attempts to use color indices `2`, which indicates that two colors should be defined for `Target`, but only one color was defined initially.

To fix these errors, I will:

- Update the `Crate` and `Target` objects with the correct number of colors and ensure the sprite configuration uses appropriate indices.
- Double-check any other discrepancies in the OBJECTS section for potential mistakes.

Here's the repaired PuzzleScript code:

### Explanation
- **Crate**: I added a duplicate color to provide the necessary two colors for the `.` and `1` indices in the sprite design.
- **Target**: I added a second color (light green) to ensure there are two colors for the `0` indices in the sprite design.

Now the object definitions align with their sprite configurations, matching color indices with their corresponding color definitions.
