To fix the reported errors, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Crate Object's Color Reference Issue:**  
   The code tries to access colors in the palette of the `Crate` object that are not defined. The palette must have a corresponding color for each number used in the object pattern.

2. **Target Object's Color Reference Issue:**  
   Similarly, the `Target` object attempts to use a color index that isn't defined. We need to ensure that the palette has a corresponding color for any number used in the pattern.

3. **Consistency between Object and Legend Definitions:**  
   Make sure all objects and legends are used correctly within the game rules and levels.

Here's the corrected code:

### Notes:
- **Crate Colors**: I've added a second color, `darkbrown`, to `Crate`'s palette so that number `1` can be correctly referenced.
- **Target Colors**: Adjusted `Target` by using already defined colors (`green` for `2`) in its palette for consistent use.
- **CrateOnTarget Colors**: Added `darkgreen` to reflect a second color and adjusted the pattern to match the indices used.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors and enable the game to function as expected.
