The error in the console output indicates that there is a rule with mismatched pattern lengths on the left and right sides of the transformation arrow (`->`). Specifically, each pattern in the rules must have a corresponding pattern of equal length on both sides of the rule. 

Upon examining the code, the problematic rule is likely this one:

```plaintext
[ CrateOnTarget ] -> [ Crate | Target ]
```

This rule transitions a single object on the left side (`CrateOnTarget`) into two objects on the right (`Crate` and `Target`). In PuzzleScript, each cell in a pattern should correspond to exactly one cell in the output pattern structure.

To fix this, we'll need to rearrange the rule to correctly represent the state transition. The solution is to ensure that the right-hand side pattern matches the structure and length of the pattern on the left side. Here's a revised version of the game code:

In this corrected version, the rule `[ CrateOnTarget | Target ] -> [ Crate | Target ]` has been modified to operate over a position where `CrateOnTarget` and `Target` overlap correctly, ensuring that the dimensions of the input and output patterns match. This should eliminate the error noted in the original console output.
