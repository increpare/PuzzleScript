To repair the provided PuzzleScript code, I need to address the errors related to color indices for the Wall and Player objects. Here's the plan:

1. **Wall Object**: The error messages indicate that the Wall object (currently defined with gray) is attempting to use multiple color indices (such as 1) when only one color (gray) is defined. Since the Wall is meant to be gray, we need to ensure the representation utilizes only that single color index, `0`.

2. **Player Object**: The error occurs because the Player object is trying to use a third color index (i.e., `3`), but only two colors are provided in the palette. We should either remove the reference to the third color or add an additional color to the palette for Player.

With these considerations, here's the corrected PuzzleScript code:

Changes made:
- **Wall**: Updated the sprite definition to use `0` consistently across all rows, given there's only one color in its palette.
- **Player**: Modified the sprite to not reference a non-existent third color index; now, only `0` (blue) and `1` (lightblue) are used.

This version of the code should compile without errors.
