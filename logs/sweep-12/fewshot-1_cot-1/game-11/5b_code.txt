Before addressing the errors, let's understand what each error message means and how to fix it:

1. **Maps not rectangular**: This occurs when the rows in a level are not of equal length. We need to make sure each row has the same number of columns.

2. **Sprite dimensions**: Every sprite defined needs to be exactly 5x5. The `Background` sprite here is not 5x5. We should adjust it by adding padding or fixing it to ensure it's 5x5.

3. **Rule pattern mismatch errors**: Each rule's left-hand-side (LHS) pattern needs to be matched by a corresponding pattern on the right-hand-side (RHS) with equal length (number of cells). We should ensure the correct correspondence between them.

Now let's fix these issues:

- Fix the `Background` sprite to be 5x5.
- Adjust level representations to ensure all rows are the same length.
- Make sure all rules have matching LHS and RHS of the same length.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

**Changes Made:**
- `Background` object is now a 5x5 dimension sprite.
- Adjusted rule patterns: Corrected `[ CrateOnTarget ] -> [ Crate ]` to `[ CrateOnTarget ] -> [ Crate | Target ]` to reflect the correct rule application context.
- Levels: Extended all rows to be the same length to maintain rectangular maps where needed.

With these changes, your PuzzleScript code should compile correctly without errors.
