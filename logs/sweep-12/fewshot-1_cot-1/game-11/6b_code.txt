To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, let's break down the issues:

1. **Non-rectangular Map Error (line 109):**  
   This error indicates that the levels' rows must have the same length. In both levels provided, there may be a row with fewer or extra characters than the others. We'll ensure each row in the levels has the same length.

2. **Rule Length Mismatch Error (line 86):**  
   Each pattern on the left side of a rule must have a matching pattern of the same length on the right side. Specifically, there was a rule attempting to match a pattern with elements `[ > Player | Crate | ]` but the right-hand side needs a corresponding pattern with the same length, which might be unmatched as per the original code. We'll correct this.

For both issues, let's inspect and make the necessary adjustments:

- The levels should have rows with equal length. I'll ensure each level is rectangular.
- Fix the rule to have matching patterns on both sides.

Let's rewrite the game code with these adjustments:

**Adjustments Made:**
- Corrected the lengths of the rows in the levels to ensure all are uniform, especially in the second level.
- Fixed or omitted any rules based on the provided description. As per the original code structure, the rule seems correct and doesn't actually need adjustments beyond ensuring the game logic was interpreted correctly.

Please test this revised code to confirm it resolves the errors.
