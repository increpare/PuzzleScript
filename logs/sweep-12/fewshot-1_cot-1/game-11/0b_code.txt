To create a PuzzleScript game, we'll need to define the following components: title, author, objects, legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. Hereâ€™s a plan of action:

1. **Title and Author**: Begin the game with a title and author information.
2. **Objects**: Define various game elements with distinct colors and appearances.
3. **Legend**: Map characters to game objects to use them in the level design.
4. **Collision Layers**: Set up the order of object interactions.
5. **Rules**: Implement game logic using rules describing interactions of objects.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define what conditions must be met for the player to win.
7. **Levels**: Design a few levels to showcase the game's mechanics.

With these plans in place, I'll create a simple game where the player pushes crates to targets. The game will feature the basic mechanics introduced in classic puzzle games like Sokoban.

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: Define the player, crates, walls, targets, and crates on targets.
- **Legend**: Associates symbols with game elements.
- **Collision Layers**: Specify how objects interact with one another.
- **Rules**: Handle object interactions and transformations, such as player pushing crates, crates landing on targets, and transitioning to a different state.
- **Win Conditions**: All crates need to be on targets to win.
- **Levels**: Two levels, increasing in complexity, are created for the player to navigate and solve by placing all crates on targets.

This setup provides a foundational Sokoban-style game using the core principles of PuzzleScript.
