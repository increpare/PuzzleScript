To address the error related to the object "CrateOnTarget", we need to include this object in the correct collision layer. This will ensure that the object is properly registered in the game and can interact with other elements as intended. Here's a step-by-step plan to fix the issue:

1. Identify the error line and understand that it indicates "CrateOnTarget" isn't assigned to a collision layer.
2. Review the collision layers section of the code (`COLLISIONLAYERS`) and decide where to place "CrateOnTarget".
3. Since "CrateOnTarget" is a variation of a "Crate" on a "Target", it should share the same layer as "Crate" to ensure all crates, whether on a target or not, interact consistently with the player and other game elements.
4. Modify the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to include "CrateOnTarget" in the same layer as "Crate".

Revised code with corrected `COLLISIONLAYERS`:

This modification ensures that the "CrateOnTarget" is recognized by the game engine and can participate in the game's collision and interaction logic appropriately.
