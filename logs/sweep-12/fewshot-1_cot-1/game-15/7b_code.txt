The error message indicates that the rule `[ Player Goal ] -> [ Player Background ]` is problematic because it isn't possible to replace `Goal` while simultaneously keeping the `Player` at the same cell. The rule also shouldn't set `Goal` to `Background`, because logically that would make the `Goal` behave as an empty space.

Instead, we need to adjust this win condition by ensuring that the player still interacts with the goal properly. A better way would be to set a specific win condition that checks when the player is on the goal. Then we remove any rules that try to overwrite the `Goal` layer directly.

Let's address this by implementing a correct win condition that detects when the player reaches a position overlapping with the `Goal`.

Here's the revised code:

**Changes Made:**

1. Removed the rule `[ Player Goal ] -> [ Player Background ]` since it was causing the overlap issue.
2. Adjusted the win condition to `Some Player on Goal`. This checks if the player successfully moves onto the goal, which implicitly achieves the game's objective without modifying the `Goal` object.
3. Kept the existing late restart rule for when `Player` touches a `Wall`â€”this ensures that levels will automatically reset when this happens.
   
These changes ensure the game can correctly detect and handle the win condition without needing to replace the `Goal` object directly, fixing the compilation error you encountered.
