To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Define the Game Concept**: Create a simple game where the player navigates through a maze to reach a goal. Let's call the game "Maze Explorer".

2. **Define Objects**: Identify all the objects necessary for the game. At minimum, we need a player, walls, a goal, and a background.

3. **Define Rules**: Establish movement rules for the player, and interactions such as reaching the goal that triggers the win condition.

4. **Define Win Conditions**: Specify when the game is won, e.g., when the player reaches the goal.

5. **Define Levels**: Create a few levels to demonstrate the gameplay.

With this plan in mind, here's the complete PuzzleScript game code:

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: `Background`, `Wall`, `Player`, and `Goal` are the essential pieces. Each is visually represented using simple 5x5 boxes or dots.
  
- **Legend**: Maps symbols to the corresponding objects to simplify level design.

- **Collision Layers**: Ensures that the objects exist in the correct layers, ensuring movement and interactions work as expected.

- **Rules**: Define the core interaction - moving onto a goal does not push it away but acknowledges its presence, implying reaching the goal.

- **Win Conditions**: Specifies that the game is won when the player is on the goal.

- **Levels**: Three levels demonstrate increasing complexity. The player (`P`) must navigate through walls (`#`) to reach the goal (`G`).

This code will produce a simple yet complete PuzzleScript game. Adjustments can be made for complexity, graphics, or additional features as desired.
