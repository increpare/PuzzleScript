The errors reported in the PuzzleScript code are due to comments not being properly formatted as comments in the RULES section. The PuzzleScript language expects rule definitions to be inside square brackets and does not recognize natural language comments or descriptions directly inline with the rules without using a comment indicator.

In PuzzleScript, comments are denoted by parentheses `()` and anything inside is treated as a comment. Since PuzzleScript does not support inline comments in the RULES section without parentheses, the incorrectly placed natural language comments are being interpreted as rules, causing the errors.

To fix the code:
1. Remove or properly comment (using parentheses) the natural language text in the RULES section.
2. Ensure all actual rules are correctly formatted with objects inside square brackets and separated by valid directional indicators.
3. Make sure that the win condition correctly checks if the Player is on the Goal.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

```

I have enclosed the comments in parenthesis where applicable in the LEVELS section and ensured the RULES section does not contain misconstrued comments. This will resolve the compilation errors and allow the game to run correctly.
