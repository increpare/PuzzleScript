To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider several elements: defining the objects in the game, creating a legend to simplify object referencing, specifying collision layers, defining rules for interactions and movements, setting win conditions, and crafting levels. Additionally, it's important to incorporate thematic elements such as colors and sounds to make the game engaging.

For this game, let's design a simple puzzle game, "Treasure Quest," where the player is a treasure hunter trying to collect all the coins while avoiding traps. We will define a straightforward objective, create necessary objects, and set rules for movement and interactions.

**Key Elements:**
1. **Objects**: Player, Treasure (Coin), Trap, Wall, Background.
2. **Legend**: Simplifying references to objects with symbols.
3. **Collision Layers**: Establishing which objects can overlap or block each other.
4. **Rules**: Allow player movement and define interactions with traps.
5. **Win Conditions**: All coins collected.
6. **Levels**: Creating various layouts for the player to navigate.

**Plan:**
- Define graphical representations and colors for each object.
- Implement movement rules and interaction logic.
- Set win conditions based on game objectives.
- Design levels with increasing complexity.

Below is the complete PuzzleScript code for "Treasure Quest":

In this simple game, the player collects coins while avoiding traps. Walls block the player's movement, and touching a trap results in failure by restarting the level. Coins are collected by moving over them, and the level is won when all coins are gathered. Each level adds slightly more complexity and challenges for the player to navigate.
