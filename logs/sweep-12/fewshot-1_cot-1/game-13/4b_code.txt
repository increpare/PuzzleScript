The error messages indicate that there is a mismatch between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of certain rules in terms of the number of patterns. Each cell pattern specified on the left should have a corresponding cell pattern on the same position on the right. For example, if there is a pattern of two cells on the left, there should be two cells on the right.

Let's address the problematic rules:

1. **Rule [ Player | Door ] -> [ Player ]**:
   - This rule is attempting to model the interaction of the player with a door, but there is one cell on the left-hand side of the door and none on the right-hand side, which causes the error. We should either remove the right-hand side of that pattern or handle it if it deals with a new object being added there.

2. **Rule [ Player | Door | Key ] -> [ Player | ]**:
   - This rule needs that the key should remain in the rule setup, but it should remove the door. Therefore, the right pattern corresponding to "Door" should be empty.

Each rule must have a balanced number of entities on the left and right unless movement (like using '>' for directionality on the player) is taking place.

Let's rewrite the game code to correct these errors:

- **Changed Rule (line 85):** The problematic rule `[ Player | Door ] -> [ Player ]` was not strictly necessary since the rule governs by default (player cannot move into a door without a key). Thus, this rule was removed.
- **Changed Rule (line 88):** Rewritten to properly handle removing the door when a player with the key moves into it. The key remains with the player until they pass through the door.

Now, the syntax and logic should be correct, and the related errors should be resolved.
