The errors in the code stem from the use of inline comments in the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript doesn't support inline comments using `//`. To fix these errors, we need to remove the comment syntax and ensure the format aligns with PuzzleScript's requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

I have removed the inline comments and retained only one comment in the rules for descriptive clarity (it's not actually processed by PuzzleScript, it's just for humans reading the code). You can choose to remove these comments entirely if needed. This should address the compilation errors.
