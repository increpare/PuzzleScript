To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code and address the errors reported in the console output, let's follow these steps:

1. **Define Objects:** The game needs objects to be defined in the `OBJECTS` section. This includes defining the player, walls, and any other objects (e.g., 'K', 'E', 'D').

2. **Define Collision Layers:** Every object should be placed in a collision layer, especially the player and any entities that will interact with the player.

3. **Define the Background:** An object must be designated as the background.

4. **Define the Player:** The game must recognize a player object.

5. **Add Levels:** Ensure the level is correctly included and formatted.

Here's the repaired code:

**Explanation of Repairs:**

- **Define Objects:** All entities mentioned in the level ('P', 'K', 'D', 'E', '#') are now defined in the `OBJECTS` section. I chose simple two-dimensional representations for each object.
  
- **Collision Layers:** I have added all objects to collision layers, allowing the game mechanics to function properly.

- **Background:** The '.' character is defined as "Background" to fill empty spaces in levels.

- **Player Definition:** The 'P' character is defined as a player and represented as 'Player' in the `LEGEND`.

- **Level Inclusion:** The level layout from the original code is now under the `LEVELS` section.

With these adjustments, the game should now run without errors.
