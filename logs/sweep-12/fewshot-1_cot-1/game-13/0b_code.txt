To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we will need the following components:

1. **Title and Author:** This sets the introduction of the game.
2. **Objects:** Define the visual elements and game pieces.
3. **Legend:** Map simple symbols to the objects for easier level design.
4. **Collision Layers:** Determine which objects can overlap or stack.
5. **Rules:** Establish how the game objects interact and the mechanics of the game.
6. **Win Conditions:** Set criteria for completing a level.
7. **Levels:** Design at least one level for the player to play.

The game concept chosen here is a simple maze puzzle where the player must collect keys to unlock doors and reach the exit. The player moves through a maze, collects keys, and opens matching doors to progress to the exit point.

Let's write the complete code below.

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** Include `Player`, `Wall`, `Key`, `Door`, `Exit`, and empty space represented by `Background`.
- **Legend:** Maps simpler symbols to the objects for convenience in level creation.
- **Collision Layers:** Ensure that the player cannot pass through walls, but can collect keys, unlock doors, and reach exits.
- **Rules:** Allow the player to collect keys and unlock doors, preventing movement if a door is present without a key.
- **Win Conditions:** The player must reach the `Exit` tile to win.
- **Level Design:** A simple maze that includes key collection and door unlocking mechanics to reach the exit. 

This template can be expanded with more levels, keys, and doors to increase complexity.
