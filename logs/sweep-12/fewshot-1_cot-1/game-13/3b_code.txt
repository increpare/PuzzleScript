To resolve the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we should follow these steps:

1. **Error 1 ("COLLISIONLAYERS" is out of order):** The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is currently placed before the `SOUNDS` section. According to PuzzleScript's requirements, the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should come after the `SOUNDS` section, or a `SOUNDS` section should be provided even if itâ€™s empty. Adding an empty `SOUNDS` section will resolve this error.

2. **Errors 2-4 (Name references in rules):** The rules section references objects like "player", "key", "door" in lowercase. PuzzleScript is case-sensitive, and since these objects are defined with capitalized names ("Player", "Key", "Door"), we need to ensure the rules use the correct, capitalized names.

3. **Structural Review:** Given that the syntax seems correct besides the mentioned errors, we'll ensure sections are appropriately ordered and formatted.

Here is the fixed version of the code:

**Summary of Changes:**
- Added an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.
- Updated rule definitions to match case-sensitive object names.
- Retained structural integrity and the logical order of code sections. 

This corrected code should resolve all reported compilation errors.
