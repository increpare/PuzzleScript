To repair the provided PuzzleScript game code, we'll first identify and address the errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Sound token errors**: The errors for lines 65 and 66 ("unexpected sound token") indicate that `blockmove` and `goalreached` were incorrectly used as sound identifiers. These should be defined in the `SOUNDS` section. However, PuzzleScript only supports a few predefined sounds or sample sounds through numbers or other methods. We'll use general sound identifiers like `sfx1` for simplicity.

2. **Name "blockmove" referred to in a rule does not exist**: We'll define a sound effect named `sfx1` to replace `blockmove`.

3. **Objects outside of square brackets**: The line `# Teleportation Rules` is commented as a rule comment, but it should have been formatted correctly to avoid it being read as a rule instruction. We'll ensure that rules do not place objects outside of square brackets except in the intended rule structure.

4. **Correct formatting of teleportation rules**: The original teleportation logic is missing proper translation into functioning rules. We'll reformat and repair this logic.

5. **Overall syntax and structure validation**: We'll ensure all sections are logically ordered and properly closed, removing any potentially confusing bits of code. 

Based on the identified issues, here's the corrected version of the code:
