To address the errors and issues presented in the PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to take the following steps:

1. **Error in Rule Comments:** In the provided code, the rules are using comments starting with "; Teleportation Rules" and "; Goal Interaction". PuzzleScript does not support comments beginning with semicolon ";", so these will need to be removed or replaced.

2. **Definition of Legend Symbols:** The error suggests the symbol "." in the levels has not been properly defined or linked in the legend section. Although "Background" and "Floor" are defined, the legend does not explicitly include a mapping for the dot (.) to these objects. We will add a legend entry for it.

3. **Console Output Errors:** The errors point out problems occurring at specific lines and symbols not mapped, especially ".", which can be resolved by better legend definitions.

By addressing these points, we should be able to resolve the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

Key changes made:
- Removed the incorrect semi-colon comment lines which caused errors during compilation.
- Ensured there is a legend entry for the "." symbol to map to "Background" or "Floor", addressing the missing key issue.

With these adjustments, the code should now interpret correctly without causing reference errors, and the legend mapping should resolve the levels correctly.
