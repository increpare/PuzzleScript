To fix the errors, let's go through them one by one and make the necessary corrections:

1. **Color Palette Errors (lines 15, 16, 17):**
   The `Player` object is defined with one color but the sprite definition is using multiple indices (0, 1). We need to define more colors for the `Player`.

2. **Unexpected Sound Token (line 65):**
   This error indicates that the sound name `Crate` is unexpected, so we'll ensure we use proper and defined sound event names.

3. **Background Layer Error (line 72):**
   The `Background` must be in a layer by itself. This can be resolved by separating `Background` from `Floor` in the `COLLISIONLAYERS`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation:

- **Player Colors Fixed:** The `Player` object now has two colors defined: `DarkBlue` and `LightBlue`. The sprite uses these indices correctly.
- **Sound Token Updated:** The sound event name `Crate Move` was corrected to `Block Move`, a more appropriate term.
- **Background Layer Separated:** The `Background` layer is now separated from `Floor` in the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section, resolving the layering error.
