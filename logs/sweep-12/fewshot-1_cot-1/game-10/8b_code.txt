The errors listed in the console output can be addressed by examining the rules and legend in the provided PuzzleScript code.

### Error Analysis and Fixes:

1. **Unexpected inputs in rules**: 
   The error on lines that mention `; Teleportation Interaction` and `; Goal Interaction` arise because comments in PuzzleScript shouldn't include `;` or be read as keywords.

2. **Dot character not defined properly**:
   The error regarding the `.` symbol on line 105 usually indicates that while the dot is likely included as a placeholder to represent `Background` or `Floor` in the `LEGEND`, it might be that the `Background` or `Floor` objects aren't correctly placed where needed.

3. **Rule Syntax Errors**: 
   The rules should correctly process teleportation and should also account for block movement upon player interaction with or without teleport presence.

The core problems come from incorrect comments marked by semicolons and the way the teleport mechanism and goal mechanism are structured.

Here's the repaired version of the game code with comments removed and necessary adjustments in the legend:

This version removes the semicolon comments and correctly uses the legend mapping to avoid ambiguity. The logic for each of the features in the game (teleporter functionality and block-goal interaction) is maintained while ensuring syntax correctness in the context of PuzzleScript.
