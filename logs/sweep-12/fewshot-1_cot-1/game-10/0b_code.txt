Creating a complete PuzzleScript game involves several steps, including defining the game's title, objects, rules, and levels. I'll design a simple yet interesting puzzle game, inspired by classic block-pushing games like "Sokoban," but with a twist involving teleportation.

**Plan:**

1. **Title and Game Info:** Decide on a suitable title and provide basic game information.
2. **Define Objects:** Create player, goal, wall, block, teleporter, and floor objects.
3. **Define Legend:** Set up abbreviations for use within the level designs.
4. **Sound Effects:** Add basic sound effects for movement and achievements.
5. **Collision Layers:** Define object layers to control interactions.
6. **Rules:** Establish movement and game logic rules, especially for teleportation.
7. **Win Conditions:** Define conditions for winning the level.
8. **Levels:** Create a few levels to complete the game.

Now, let's proceed with writing the code.

**Explanation:**
- **Objects:** Include basic elements like the player, blocks, goals, walls, teleporters, and floor.
- **Rules:** Define movement rules and interactions, particularly handling teleportation mechanics whereby a player standing on one teleporter instantly moves to another teleporter (if one exists).
- **Win Conditions:** Achieve all blocks on goals.
- **Levels:** Provide a progression of three levels of increasing difficulty, incorporating the use of teleportation.
