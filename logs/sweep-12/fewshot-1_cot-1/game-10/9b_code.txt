To repair the code, we'll address the specific errors one by one:

1. **Sprite Graphic Dimensions**: The `Player` and `Teleporter` sprite graphics must be 5x5, but they are currently not. I'll add one line with `.` to the `Player` and two lines to the `Teleporter` to make them 5x5.

2. **Unknown Symbols in Maps**: The maps are using spaces (` `) which are not defined in the `LEGEND`. We'll change them to represent `Background`.

3. **Movements in Late Rules**: Movement operators should not be used in late rules. We'll adjust the rules or relocate them to standard rules.

4. **Pattern Length Mismatch**: The rule involving the `Goal | Block` pattern doesn't comply with the required format. I'll adjust the length of patterns in this rule to make them match.

Here is the corrected code:

This version should run without errors, and correctly implements the original design intent.
