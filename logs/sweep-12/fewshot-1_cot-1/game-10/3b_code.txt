The errors in the provided code relate to misuse and misplacement of the SOUND tokens and an incorrect use of comments within the RULES section. Additionally, the teleportation and movement comments are incorrectly treated as if they were parts of rules due to the absence of hash symbols to denote them as comments.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be fixed:

1. **SOUNDS Section** should have defined sound effects after object actions, not as standalone tokens in the rules. To address this, remove the sound effect tokens `blockmove` and `goalreached` from the rules section and define them as sounds associated with specific actions.

2. Correct misuse of comments with `#` by ensuring they start at the beginning of the line or after the arrow operator in a rule if necessary.

3. Ensure all objects in rules are properly bracketed and remove any operations without any brackets.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
- Removed `blockmove` and `goalreached` from lines 87 and 90 that improperly placed sound tokens in rules not associated with specific actions.
- Included the correct use of sound effects with corresponding rules to denote actions that are associated with sound.
- Comments (#) added correctly to clarify sections in RULES for teleportation and goal interaction.
