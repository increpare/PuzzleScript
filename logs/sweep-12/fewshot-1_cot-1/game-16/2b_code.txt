The error messages indicate that the Player object's color sections are trying to access colors that aren't available in its palette. Specifically, the player object defines colors indexed at positions 2 and 3, but only two colors are defined in the Player object. Let's address the issue by correcting the color specifications for the Player object. We can add more colors to the palette of the Player, ensuring they can be accessed as defined. Here's the adjusted code:

### Explanation:
- I added two additional colors (`Black` and `White`) to the Player object to match the declarations on lines 19, 20, and 21. This ensures that when accessing colors at those indices, valid colors are available, thereby resolving the error messages.
  
With these changes, the game should compile correctly without errors related to accessing undefined colors in the Player object.
