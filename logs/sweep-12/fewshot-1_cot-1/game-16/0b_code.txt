To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need the following components: a game title, author details, the list of objects with their colors and graphics, a legend defining the symbols used for the objects in the game, collision layers to define groups of objects and their interactions, movement rules for gameplay, win conditions, and levels for players to play in.

**Plan:**
1. **Choose a Game Theme:** Let's create a simple Sokoban-inspired game where the player pushes crates onto targets.
2. **Define Objects:** We'll define objects for the background, walls, player, crates, and targets.
3. **Set Up the Legend:** Identify the symbols to represent these objects in the level design.
4. **Collision Layers:** Define how the player, crates, and walls interact.
5. **Rules:** Write movement rules for the player and crate interactions.
6. **Win Conditions:** Define when the game is won (e.g., all targets covered by crates).
7. **Design Levels:** Create a few levels that gradually increase in complexity.

**Game Title:** Crate Pusher

This code includes the title, author details, a concise set of objects with representative graphics, a legend, collision layers, basic movement rules for pushing crates, win conditions, and three levels to showcase gameplay progression. This structure allows for easy modification, enabling you to expand upon the game with more complex features and additional objects or rules if desired.
