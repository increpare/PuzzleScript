The error messages indicate that the color palette defined for the "Background" and "Wall" objects are incorrect. Specifically, the number of colors listed doesn't match the number of colors used in their respective sprite definitions. Each color in the color palette is separated by a space, and it appears there is only one color defined for these objects, whereas multiple colors are required to properly define their patterns.

Here's how we can fix the issues:

1. **Background Object**: The pattern specified for "Background" has more than one color in its binary representation; however, there's only one color (green) defined in the color palette. We need to define at least two colors in the palette.

2. **Wall Object**: Similar to the "Background", "Wall" has more than one color in its binary representation. We need to define at least two colors in the palette.

3. **Update Color Definitions**: The current design suggests these might be binary patterns, with '1' as the main color and '0' as the secondary (background) color.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

**Explanation**: 

- The "Background" object's color palette now uses two tones: green (for '1') and darkgreen (for '0').
- The "Wall" object's color palette now uses two tones: brown (for '1') and darkbrown (for '0').
