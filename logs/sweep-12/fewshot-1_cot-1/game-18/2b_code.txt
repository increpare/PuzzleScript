Upon examining the console output, it appears that there is an error related to an unexpected token for the "winlevel" sound. In PuzzleScript, the sound identifiers (e.g., MOVE, RESTART) need to match the allowed sound events. The specific sound event "winlevel" you provided does not exist, so we should replace it with the correct event name. Sounds typically use identifiers like MOVE, RESTART, UNSPECIFIED_SOUND, etc. Since the rest of the game seems to follow the usual pattern for a simple box-pusher game, I'll replace "winlevel" with "endlevel" in the SOUNDS section.

Here is the fixed version of your PuzzleScript code:

With this change, the game should compile successfully, and the level completion sound should trigger when the win conditions are met.
