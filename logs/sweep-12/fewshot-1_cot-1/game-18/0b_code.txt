To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several key components: the game's title, objects, their appearances/colors, rules, win conditions, and levels. We'll stick to a simple puzzle-style game, like the classic "Sokoban" game where the player pushes boxes to target locations.

Our game, "Box Pusher", will involve a player who must push crates onto designated target spots. The following describes the plan and necessary components:

1. **Title and Author**:
   - Set the game title and author information.

2. **Objects**:
   - Define objects such as Background, Wall, Player, Crate, and Target.
   - Use simple ASCII art and colors to illustrate each object.

3. **Legend**:
   - Assign mnemonic symbols to each object for easy reference in the level maps.

4. **Sounds**:
   - Create sound effects for crate movement and level completion.

5. **Collision Layers**:
   - Define layers to manage object interactions, ensuring correct gameplay behavior.

6. **Rules**:
   - Define movement rules: the player can push crates, but only horizontally to simulate classic Sokoban constraints.
   - Optionally implement a rule to constrain the player from passing through or pushing more than one crate in a line.

7. **Win Conditions**:
   - The game is won when all target spots are covered by crates.

8. **Levels**:
   - Construct a set of levels, starting simple and increasing in complexity.

Now, I'll put this plan into code within a complete PuzzleScript game:

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: Background is green. Wall is brown, Player is blue with a white border, Crate is orange with a white border, and Target is a simple red dot.
- **Rules**: Implement a simple Sokoban pushing mechanic where the player pushes crates horizontally (not vertically).
- **Win Condition**: All crates must be on targets.
- **Levels**: Two levels with varying difficulties to illustrate gameplay.

Feel free to add more levels or adjust object designs for further enhancement.
