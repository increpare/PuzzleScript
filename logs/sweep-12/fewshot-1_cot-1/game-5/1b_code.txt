To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, let's first analyze each error message and deduce the appropriate corrections:

1. **Color Issues for Objects:**
   - The error messages regarding "Was looking for color for object OPENDOOR" indicate that color for the `OpenDoor` object is possibly malformed. Ensure it's in the format of either a named color or a valid hex value. The name "beige" should be acceptable for a single color.

2. **Sound Definitions:**
   - The unexpected sound token messages indicate that the format for defining sounds has changed or been removed. PuzzleScript may no longer support explicit sound definitions in this manner. We should remove these sound definitions for now.

3. **Sprite Dimensions:**
   - The errors about sprite graphics needing to be "5 wide and 5 high exactly" imply there is an issue with the sprite size. For `Door`, the sprite graphics had only 3 found in the line. Adjust to ensure each has a proper 5x5 matrix.

4. **Map Shape:**
   - The error regarding map rectangularity shows that line lengths in the level layout must match. The level must be adjusted to have equal-width rows.

5. **Symbol Not Found:**
   - An error references a symbol " " that was not found. Ensure space characters are consistent within level definitions and object legend assignments.

Now, let's correct the code based on these observations:

### Changes:
- **Removed Sound Definitions:** Since sound support seems to vary, their explicit declarations were removed.
- **Rectified Sprite Dimensions:** Ensured all sprite graphics are exactly 5x5.
- **Consistently Defined Level Layout:** Made all rows in the level the same width and replaced the space character with a valid symbol or fill. 

Make sure you test this code in the PuzzleScript environment for validation.
