To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider the essential components of a game as described in the PuzzleScript language. These components include the title, author, objects, legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. Let me outline the steps to design a basic game:

1. **Define the Game's Concept**: I'll create a simple puzzle game where a player collects keys to unlock doors and reach a target.

2. **Title and Author**: Set a game title and author details.

3. **Objects Definition**: Define the visual and logical representation of each object. I'll need objects for the player, keys, doors, walls, background, and a target.

4. **Legend**: Create a legend to simplify referencing objects.

5. **Collision Layers**: Specify which objects can collide and interact.

6. **Rules**: Define the interactions between objects, such as picking up keys, unlocking doors, and moving the player.

7. **Win Conditions**: Establish the winning condition for the game (e.g., reaching a target tile).

8. **Levels**: Design one or more levels using the defined objects to create a playable game.

Here's the code for the complete PuzzleScript game:

**Explanation**:
- The game is titled "Collect and Unlock," and the player (represented by a blue character) must collect keys to transform doors into open paths.
- The player wins by moving onto the target tile.
- The code contains a single level where the player starts near a key and must unlock a door to reach the target. Simple collision rules ensure that a key is collected when touched and a door becomes an open path when the player has reached it.
- Use simple sound effects to enhance interactions like "pickup_key" when collecting a key and "unlock_door" when unlocking a door.

This code provides a straightforward and complete PuzzleScript game example.
