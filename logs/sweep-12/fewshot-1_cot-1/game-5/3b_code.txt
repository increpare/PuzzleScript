To repair the code, we need to address the following issues highlighted in the console output:

1. **Maps must be rectangular**: This error indicates that in the LEVELS section, each row of the map must have the same length. We need to ensure that all lines in a level are of equal length.

2. **Sprite Size Error**: The height of the `Door` sprite is less than 5x5. We need to fix the size of the `Door` sprite to match the required dimensions.

3. **Symbol Error**: The parser does not recognize spaces " " in levels by default, so we need to specify it in the LEGEND section to map it to `Background`.

After addressing these issues, here is the corrected version of the code:

**Explanation of Changes Made:**
- Ensured that every sprite is 5x5, as required. The `Door` sprite was adjusted to be 5x5.
- Added a LEGEND entry for spaces `" "`, mapping them to `Background` to resolve the undefined symbol error.
- Confirmed that the level map is rectangular by ensuring each row is of equal length. 

With these corrections, the code should compile and run the game without errors.
