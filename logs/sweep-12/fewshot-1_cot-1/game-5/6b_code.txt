To correct the PuzzleScript game code, I need to address the errors identified in the console output:

1. On line 51, the sprite for `Door` is only three lines tall but should be five lines tall to comply with the requirement that all sprite graphics are 5x5.

2. Line 69 indicates an incorrect usage of the equals signs. The sound section is empty, so I can remove or comment the section altogether.

3. Line 99 suggests the presence of an undefined space character used in the map. I need to replace the space characters in the map definition with a valid object, which in most cases would be the background.

4. The level on line 100 is not rectangular. Each line of the level definition must be of equal length. I will add extra background characters to ensure all lines are the same length.

With the above corrections in mind, here's the corrected version of the code:

In this repaired version, I've ensured that:
- The `Door` sprite is now 5x5.
- The empty space character has been properly replaced by the `Background` in the level map.
- All lines in the level map are of the same length, maintaining it as a proper rectangle.
- Comments explain empty sections (like sounds).
