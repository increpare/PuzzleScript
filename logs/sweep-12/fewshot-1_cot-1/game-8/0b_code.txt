To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I'll design a simple tile-based puzzle game. PuzzleScript games typically involve objects, rules, win conditions, and levels. The game should include basic movement mechanics, and an objective to achieve a win condition.

**Game Concept:**
- Title: "Block Pusher"
- Objective: Move the player to push blocks onto goal tiles to win.
- Mechanic: Moveable blocks and static walls. The player can push blocks but cannot walk through walls.
- Win Condition: All blocks must be pushed onto goal tiles.

**Plan:**
1. Define game metadata (title and author).
2. Specify the palette of colors to be used.
3. Define the game objects, including the player, block, wall, and goal.
4. Set up the collision layers to manage interactions.
5. Implement the rules for movement and block pushing.
6. Establish win conditions, i.e., all blocks on goals.
7. Create a few levels to demonstrate and play the game.

Here's a complete PuzzleScript game code implementing the above plan:

**Explanation:**
- **Objects** are defined, such as `Player`, `Block`, `Wall`, `Target`, and `Background`.
- **Legend** assigns symbols to each object for ease of use in levels.
- **CollisionLayers** specify layers to manage interactions, where walls block movement, and blocks interact with targets and the player.
- **Rules** allow the player to push blocks if there's space and no wall in the way.
- The **Win Condition** is met when all blocks cover the target tiles.
- **Levels** define layouts using the legend to place game objects. Three sample levels are provided for different challenges.
