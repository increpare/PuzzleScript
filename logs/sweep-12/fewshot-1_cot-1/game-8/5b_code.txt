To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to examine and rectify two key issues that the console output highlighted:

1. **Exception with Wall sprite:** The `Wall` object uses a color pattern that references multiple colors, but only one color is specified (`gray`). The console error indicates that colors are being accessed that haven't been defined. To fix this, we need to define a single color value for `Wall` or introduce multiple color values if the design demands more.

2. **Error regarding levels:** The semicolon `;` at the beginning of level definitions suggests a comment or a malformed level definition. In PuzzleScript, levels should not start with a semicolon; they should start directly with their layout. Let's remove the semicolons to correct this mistake.

Considering these adjustments, here is the corrected code:

**Corrections explained:**

- **Wall object shape**: Now uses a single color (`gray`) in a consistent pattern.
- **Levels corrected**: Removed semicolons before each level, directly starting with level layout descriptions to adhere to PuzzleScript syntax expectations.
