To address the errors reported by the PuzzleScript console output, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Wall Color Definition**: The error regarding the `Wall` object pertains to its color definition. In PuzzleScript, each object is defined by a color palette that should have multiple colors if using a detailed ASCII art sprite. Since `Wall` is a solid grey, it should be a mono-color which can be represented using one color in the palette.

2. **Section Order**: The error regarding the section order indicates that the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is out of place. In a PuzzleScript game, all predefined sections (like `SOUNDS`) must be included, even if they are empty. I will include an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.

Here is the corrected code:

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Wall Definition**: I specified a single color in the palette, which is `gray`. This avoids the error related to trying to access non-existing indices in the color palette.
  
- **Empty Sounds Section**: I inserted an empty `SOUNDS` section to maintain the required order of sections in the PuzzleScript file. This prevents the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section from being out of order.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors, and the game should now work correctly.
