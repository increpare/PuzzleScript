To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to make sure that the patterns on the left-hand side of each rule have a corresponding number of cells on the right-hand side. In this case, the errors arise because the rules have different numbers of cells on each side. Specifically, rules with "no Wall" need to be adjusted to match the number of conditions before and after the transformation.

Here is the revised version of the code:

```

In the corrected rules:

1. I've added `| no Wall` to the right-hand side of the rule `[> Player | Block | no Wall] -> [> Player | > Block]` to ensure both sides have equal numbers of cells.
2. The rule `[> Player | no Block] -> [> Player]` is valid, as the absence of a Block does not require an additional cell on the right.

This correction allows the game to compile and function as expected.
