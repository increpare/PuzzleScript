To address the console output errors, we need to focus on the following:

1. **Fixing Gem Object Definition:** 
   - The error suggests that there is an issue with how the colors are defined or used for the `Gem` object. The previous version of the `Gem` color definition didn't initialize with proper shading or didn't define shading properly within the grid format where each number represents different shades of the color. 

2. **Fixing Rule Definition for Movement:**
   - The error at line 81 indicates that an object appears where only directions should be used. Typically, the movement of the player should be described using player's attempt to move with an object in the condition of the rule (e.g., `right [ Player | ]`), or it can be within collision animations using expressions like (`[ > Player | ] -> [ > Player | ]`) which moves the player, but this type should serve to control pushing or similar effects and not just for movement.

**Revised Plan:**

- Correct the color definitions and initialization for the `Gem` object.
- Ensure the player movement rules are correctly implemented using directions.
  
Here's a revised version of the game code:

### Key Changes:

1. **Gem Object Fix:**
   - Ensure proper grid setup and use of numbering alignments within the format to initialize colors based on shading.

2. **Movement Rules Addition:**
   - Added directional movement rules for `Player` to define how it moves on the game grid.
  
This code should now compile and run as intended without producing errors related to color or rule definitions.
