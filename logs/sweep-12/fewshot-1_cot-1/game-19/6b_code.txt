To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following errors based on the console output:

1. **Color Error**: The error on line 37 suggests that there's an unexpected color specification for the object "Gem". This is likely due to using two colors instead of one. In PuzzleScript, each object typically uses a single color for its main appearance, unless you are specifying distinct background and foreground colors explicitly.

2. **Inconsistent color indexing**: The message about accessing color number 1 suggests that it only expects a single palette color despite having two. We'll ensure Gem has a consistent color representation.

3. **Rule Error**: The error messages on lines 81 and 84 indicate incorrect syntax usage and non-existent names "movement" and "collection". These entries do not define actionable rules and need to be corrected.

**Plan of Action**:
- Correct the color specification for the `Gem` object to use a single color. Alternatively, confirm the object's color representation matches the intended two-color format in PuzzleScript.
- Fix the rules by properly defining actions or removing the invalid directives.
- Ensure that within collision layers, rules, and condition checking, the definitions are consistent with the regular expressions and contexts PuzzleScript expects.

Here is the repaired version of the code with these considerations:

**Notes and adjustments**:
- The `Gem` object now only uses `cyan` to address the color index issue.
- Corrected collection rule to ensure that when `Player` overlaps with `Gem`, the `Gem` is removed (`DESTROY(Gem)`) to model collection properly and make the sound play.
- Re-verified level and object setups for correct initializations and objectives validities.
