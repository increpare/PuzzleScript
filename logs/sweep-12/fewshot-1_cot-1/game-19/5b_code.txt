The error messages indicate problems with the color definitions for the "Gem" object in the PuzzleScript game. Specifically, it seems there is an issue with the color names: "cyan" and "darkcyan". In PuzzleScript, colors must be defined correctly and match the available color palette options. It seems like this object definition has an incorrect color syntax or unsupported colors.

Steps to Fix the Errors:
1. Confirm valid colors in PuzzleScript: Check if "cyan" and "darkcyan" are valid colors. If unsure, use more commonly used color names.
2. Correct the "Gem" object color definition: Ensure the colors are correctly defined and supported by PuzzleScript.

Let's fix these issues in the code:

In this corrected version of the code, I have chosen "blue" and "cyan" for the "Gem" object colors, both of which should work in PuzzleScript. This should resolve the compilation errors.
