## Task Analysis

The error messages indicate the following issues:
1. The `Player` and `Wall` sprites have color indices that exceed the number of colors defined for them.
2. The color "cyan" is not being recognized for the `Gem` object.

## Plan of Action

1. **Fix Color Palettes**: 
    - Ensure that the number of colors defined matches the color indices used in each sprite. 
    - For `Player`, revise to use a consistent color pattern.
    - For `Wall`, ensure the pattern does not reference a nonexistent color index.

2. **Address Color Recognition**:
    - Decide on a color from the existing color palette or alter the palette to include "cyan".

3. **Code Update**:
    - Create consistent color patterns in the blocks of pixels via indices.

Below is the updated code that addresses these issues:

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the `Player` sprite to have a uniform pattern with valid color indices.
- Changed the `Wall` sprite to reference only the first color code for consistency.
- Included "white" and "black" colors for `Gem` to define a usable palette recognizably. These may be adjusted depending on available standard palette colors in the system supporting this script.
