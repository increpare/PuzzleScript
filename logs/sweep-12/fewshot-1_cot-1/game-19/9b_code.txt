To address the errors in the console output for the PuzzleScript game code, let's break down each error and how to fix it:

1. **Color Error for Gem Object:**
   The error messages indicate that the "Gem" object is incorrectly defined and lacks a proper color specification. PuzzleScript requires objects to have a color definition on the line just after the object name. Fixing this requires adding appropriate colors for the "Gem" object.

2. **Invalid Rule Syntax:**
   The console reports an error on line 81 due to incorrect rule syntax. The rule states `[ Player | no Player ]`, which is incorrect. Instead, we should specify the unaffected side as simply an empty space or the relevant object but not a non-existent player.

Here's the repaired code for the PuzzleScript:

### Corrections Made:
- Added colors "cyan blue" for the "Gem" object.
- Fixed the rule syntax by changing `[ Player | no Player ]` to `[ Player | ]` to correctly represent the absence of an object on the immediate move side.
- Ensured that the game should now compile and run correctly without errors.
