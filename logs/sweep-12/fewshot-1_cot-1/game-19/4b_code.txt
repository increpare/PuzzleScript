To address the errors specified in the console output, we need to make sure that the `Gem` object is defined correctly. The errors indicate that there is an issue with how the colors are being defined for the `Gem` object. In PuzzleScript, when defining an object, colors must follow a correct format and be attached appropriately to the object's pixel grid.

Here is the plan of action:
1. **Correct Color Definition**: Ensure the colors in the `Gem` object are defined correctly (i.e., using proper color names without extra spaces).
2. **Define a Consistent Pixel Grid**: The grid should consist of a valid combination of defined colors.
3. **Verify Syntax and Structure**: Double-check that all objects and rules adhere to PuzzleScript's required structure and syntax.

Here's the corrected game code:

### Explanation:
- **Gem Definition**: I adjusted the color definition for the `Gem` so that each color is correctly formatted and associated. It now uses two colors: `cyan` and `darkcyan`.
- **Pixel Grid**: Made sure the grid correctly uses defined colors (`0` for `cyan`, `1` for `darkcyan`) in the `Gem` object. 
- **Object Definitions**: Ensured all objects are consistent in their definition in terms of both grid size and format.

These changes should clear the errors and ensure the game compiles correctly.
