To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, let's analyze each reported issue and devise a plan to correct them:

1. **Line 37 Error**: The error indicates an issue with the color specification for the "Gem" object. The color list seems to have an extra space or is not well formatted.

2. **Line 47-49 Errors**: These lines seem to indicate an inconsistency in the color palette definition for the "Goal" object, which should consist of a list of color codes separated by spaces. The colors defined in the object should match the colors utilized in the sprite representation.

3. **Line 67 Error**: The error reveals an issue with the sound directive where the action verb should be specified (MOVE, DESTROY, etc.), but the script fails to meet expectations.

4. **Line 81 Error**: Objects should not appear outside of square brackets in rules, which suggests a misunderstanding of how to use rules.

The plan of action:
- Fix the color listing and formatting for "Gem" and "Goal".
- Correct the sound directive.
- Fix the rule where objects appear outside of square brackets.
- Ensure the rest of the code maintains syntactic consistency.

Now, let's correct the game code:

Changes made:
- Fixed the color for both `Gem` and `Goal` to use single colors as indicated by the error, ensuring they match the 5x5 sprite pattern.
- Corrected the sound line to use `COLLECT` instead of just listing a number.
- Provided the correct combination of win conditions with 'no' and 'and' instead of 'some'.
- Reviewed and ensured rules are using the correct syntax with brackets. 

This revision should address all highlighted issues, leading to functional compilation of the code.
