To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we should begin by determining the concept, mechanics, and goals of the game. Since PuzzleScript is well-suited for puzzle and block-pushing games, we'll design a simple game called "Gem Collector". The objective will be for the player to collect all the gems on the board and reach a goal tile.

### Game Design:

1. **Theme**: The player is a collector in a cave filled with colorful gems.
2. **Objective**: Collect all gems and reach the goal.
3. **Mechanics**:
   - The player can move up, down, left, and right.
   - Gems are collected when the player steps on their tile.
   - The level is completed when all gems are collected and the player reaches the goal tile.
4. **Obstacles**: Walls and boulders block the player's path.
5. **Visuals**: Use colors to distinguish different elements like the player, gems, walls, and goal.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Define Objects**: Create visual representations for the player, gems, walls, boulders, and goal.
2. **Specify Legend**: Create shorthand symbols for each object for easier level design.
3. **Collision Layers**: Set layers to control which objects can overlap.
4. **Rules**: Define movement and collection rules.
5. **Win Conditions**: Define how the player wins a level.
6. **Levels**: Design a series of levels with increasing complexity.

This code block represents a simple puzzle game where the player collects all gems and reaches the goal to win. The game consists of different elements represented by colors, and a few levels that demonstrate the core mechanics.
