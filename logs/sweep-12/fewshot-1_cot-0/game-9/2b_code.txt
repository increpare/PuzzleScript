message Align the crates to the targets!

Here are the changes made:
1. Added a second color to the palettes for `Player`, `RedCrate`, `GreenCrate`, `RedTarget`, and `GreenTarget` objects to match how the game uses them in the sprites.
2. Fixed the sprites for `RedTarget` and `GreenTarget` to ensure they are correctly 5x5.
3. Removed the use of undefined term "Target" in the COLLISIONLAYERS section and ensured objects `RedTarget` and `GreenTarget` were correctly part of the game layers.
