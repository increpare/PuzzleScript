**Explanation of Fixes:**
1. **Color Palette Errors:** Updated the color references for Player, RedCrate, GreenCrate, RedTarget, and GreenTarget by including a grayscale `0` to denote which areas in the pixel block should not be colored, as there was an issue with color 1 being referenced but not correctly defined. This approach uses implicit transparency with a single color setup.
2. **Console Sound Error:** Replaced `Crate MOVE` with `SFX0`, matching the expected sound token used in `RULES`. Replaced other sounds with `SFX1` and `SFX2` as placeholder sound definitions.
