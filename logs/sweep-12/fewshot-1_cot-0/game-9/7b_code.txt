### Explanation of Fix:
- Adjusted the rules for the conveyors to ensure that the crates move in the correct direction. By updating the rule to move the conveyor itself, we are ensuring that the crate advances as expected when it encounters the conveyor.
- Re-evaluated the level design for solvability. The initial level was adjusted for coherence with game mechanics.
- Checked thoroughly to ensure the game works as expected without violating any puzzle solvability norms.
