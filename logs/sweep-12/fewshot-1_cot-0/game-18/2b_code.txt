Certainly! Let's fix those errors in the `Color Maze` PuzzleScript game code.

1. The `Wall` object needs more colors defined, as it's trying to reference multiple colors based on the numbers in its design.
2. The levels contain lines that don't have consistent lengths, which means they need to be adjusted so that every row in the level is the same length.
3. In the levels section, `rC`, `gC`, `rT`, and `gT` should be uppercase to match the legend definitions (`RC`, `GC`, `RT`, `GT`).

Here's the corrected version of the original code:

I made the `Wall` colors more explicit, adjusted the level designs to be rectangular, and corrected object legend keys in levels to match their definitions. Now, this should compile without errors.
