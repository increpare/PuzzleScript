The errors in your PuzzleScript code are mainly due to inconsistencies in the row lengths of the level maps and unrecognized keys in the `LEGEND`, which are then used in levels. Here's how you can fix these issues:

1. Ensure all rows within each level are the same length to avoid rectangular constraint violations.
2. Make sure all symbols used in your level maps (e.g., `R`, `C`, `G`, `T`) are defined in the `LEGEND` section.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

This code ensures that:
- All rows in the level maps are of the same length.
- Consistent naming is used for elements in both the `LEGEND` and the `LEVELS`.
