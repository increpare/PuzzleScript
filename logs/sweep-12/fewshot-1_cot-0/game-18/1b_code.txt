### Changes Made:
1. **Color Errors:** The Wall object had incorrect dimensions for the pixel art based on color palette. The wall correctly uses one single primary color once defined as `gray`.
2. **Sprite Name Conflicts:** Changed the legend identifiers `R` and `G` for crates and targets to `rC` and `gC` for crates, and `rT` and `gT` for targets to avoid conflicts.
3. **Key "=" Not Found:** Removed the `=` character used as a separator in the level layout. Make sure the level design does not stray from the definitions in the `LEGEND`. 

These fixes ensure the game code adheres to PuzzleScript's requirements, preventing compilation errors.
