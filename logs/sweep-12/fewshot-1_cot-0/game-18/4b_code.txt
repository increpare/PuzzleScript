**Changes Made:**
1. Ensured that all levels are rectangular by adding or removing spaces where needed.
2. Fixed the incorrect usage of the shorthand for `RC`, `GC`, `RT`, and `GT`. They were concatenated into single strings, so I separated them into individual symbols.
3. Added a consistent number of rows and columns for each level to ensure they are rectangular.
