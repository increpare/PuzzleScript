Here is the repaired version of the PuzzleScript game code. I have made sure the level maps are rectangular, and adjusted the rows so that each line has the same length. Additionally, I fixed any legend errors by correcting the level design according to the legend definitions:

I ensured that all rows in the level map are consistent in length, and corrected the key usage based on the legend.
