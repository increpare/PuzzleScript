The error you encountered is due to the incorrect placement and formatting of the sound declaration. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```
In the corrected code, the `SOUNDS` section header has been changed from `SOUNDS` to `=========`. Ensure the sound section header reads as `=========`, and the placement of the `collect` sound follows that heading appropriately. Additionally, all sections of the script are appropriately delimited and correctly capitalized, corresponding to the usual syntax structure in PuzzleScript.
