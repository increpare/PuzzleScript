To resolve the issues reported in the console output, you'll need to make the following adjustments to your PuzzleScript game code:

1. Add an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section.
2. Ensure object names in the rules and win conditions are capitalized as defined in the `OBJECTS` section.
3. Correct any rule syntax issues.

Here's the repaired version of your code:

```plaintext

With these adjustments, the errors should be resolved, and the game should function as intended.
