### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the player's sprite in the `Player` object to use two colors instead of three (addressed the error in line 19).
2. Altered the rule `[ > Player | Goal ] -> [ > Player ]` to `[ > Player | Goal ] -> [ Player | Goal ]` to make sure both sides of the rule have equal patterns (addressed the error in line 60). 
3. Re-ordered collision layers to ensure that the player can move properly across the map (placed `Wall` above `Player`).
