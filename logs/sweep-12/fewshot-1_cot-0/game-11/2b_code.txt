### Summary of Changes:
1. Corrected the color specification for `CollectedGem`.
2. Adjusted the sound command to follow proper usageâ€”with `SOUND1` replacing `Collect`.
3. Ensured level maps are properly rectangular by fixing level borders and spacing issues.
4. Eliminated extra spaces and symbols not defined in `LEGEND` to avoid map errors.
