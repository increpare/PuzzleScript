Changes made:
1. Added a color specification for `CollectedGem` in the `OBJECTS` section.
2. Fixed the sound declaration for `CollectedGem Collect` in the `SOUNDS` section.
3. Updated the rule syntax in the `RULES` section to correctly handle events and actions.
4. Ensured that all level maps are rectangular and consistent in line length.
5. Replaced spaces in the level maps with the appropriate symbol or removed unnecessary spacing.
