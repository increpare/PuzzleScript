message Collect all the gems!
```

Changes made:
1. Fixed the color specification for the `CollectedGem` object by ensuring the color name is correctly used and referenced.
2. Changed the sound name to be capitalized 'GemCollected' (consistent with its usage in the rules). 
3. Updated the RULES section to correctly include the sound in the action, using the format `[ > Player | Gem ] -> [ > Player | CollectedGem GemCollected]`. 

These adjustments should correct the compilation errors and ensure the game functions as intended.
