Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issues have been fixed by correcting color definitions, removing incorrect sound definitions, and ensuring rules are accurately defined.

Changes made include:
1. Fixed the color definition for `CollectedGem` to use an existing color.
2. Removed incorrect sound definitions and references as there was no actual sound data provided.
3. Resolved syntax to prevent malformed errors (e.g., referencing `GemCollected` incorrectly).
