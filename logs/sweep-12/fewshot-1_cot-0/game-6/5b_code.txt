### Changes Made:
1. Fixed the sound event name in the `SOUNDS` section from `Star DESTROY` to `DestroyStar`, which aligns with the syntax.
2. Corrected the rule to properly use the `DESTROY` sound event, ensuring it takes effect when the player collects a star.

These changes should address the console errors and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
