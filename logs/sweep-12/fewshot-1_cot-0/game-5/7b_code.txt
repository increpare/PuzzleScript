Here's the revised version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've corrected the issues related to the color palette for the Wall and Box objects:

I fixed the following issues:
1. For the `Wall`, I filled the entire pattern using one color since only one color was defined.
2. In the `Box` object, I changed the pattern's highest value to `2` to match the number of colors defined for the sprite.

This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
