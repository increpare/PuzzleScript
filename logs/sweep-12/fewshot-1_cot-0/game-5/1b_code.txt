Here's the repaired version of the PuzzleScript code. I've corrected the errors related to color definitions for the `Wall` and `Player` objects. The `Wall` object had multiple colors referenced but only one defined. The `Player` object also had an extra color accessed. I've adjusted the sprite definitions accordingly.
