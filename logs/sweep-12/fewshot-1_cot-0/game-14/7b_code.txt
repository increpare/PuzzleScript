### Explanation:
1. Sprites were confirmed to be 5x5 based on the grid (5 characters by 5).
2. Replaced invalid "no" conditions with presence checks on walls, assuming you meant to check for the presence of walls rather than absence. So, you need `Wall` instead of `no Wall` in rules.
3. Corrected usage of "no" in rule interpretation.
4. Properly handled endings to ensure the syntax was consistent.
5. Addressed the unknown 'T' references by ensuring 'Tr' and 'Tb' are correctly used instead.
