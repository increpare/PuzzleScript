### Changes Made:
1. **Corrected the use of `no`**: The keyword `no` should be capitalized as `No` for use in rules to mean "not". However, I realized `No Background` should be used alongside the movement rules instead of `no Wall` to prevent passing through empty spaces.
2. **Corrected Legend and Win Conditions**: Removed the `T` references from the legend, win conditions, and levels. They were clearly meant for something else, but not being used properly.
3. **Fixed Level Definition**: The levels were changed to ensure that correct legend references (`Tr`, `Tb`) were present, matching the targets and ensuring they made logical sense.
