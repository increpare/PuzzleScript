Changes:
1. Removed the invalid "no" references in the rules by replacing them with object names.
2. Corrected the object definitions by ensuring that there are no misplaced identifiers.
3. Made sure the wall art pattern is consistent throughout the objects for clarity.

This code should compile without errors, and the game should function as expected.
