Changes made:
1. Fixed sprite dimensions for Background object by adding the missing lines.
2. Added the missing last line for Wall sprite.
3. Corrected the rules for swapping players to correctly refer to the absence of a player, using `no PlayerRed` and `no PlayerBlue`.
4. Resolved the key errors referring to 'T' in win conditions by ensuring the correct symbols Tr and Tb are used consistently.
