### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Sound Declaration Errors**: Replaced incorrect `Swap` and `ReachGoal` tokens with `sfx0` and `sfx1`. Corrected references in the code.

2. **Collision Layer Error**: Moved `Background` to its own layer as per requirements.

3. **Action Error**: Changed `ACTION` to `NO` which is the default interaction key for toggling between objects or states. The `NO` keyword allows cycling through objects in the game.

4. **Win Condition Error**: Corrected object name from `TargetsRed` and `TargetsBlue` to the appropriate `TargetRed` and `TargetBlue` within the win conditions.
