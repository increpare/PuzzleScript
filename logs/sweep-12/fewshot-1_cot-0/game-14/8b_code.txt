Here are the changes I made to address the errors:

1. **Line 21 Error**: The object sprites must be 5x5. I have ensured that all object definitions conform to a 5x5 size.

2. **Lines 98 & 99 Error**: Rules must use brackets to surround game objects. I've corrected these rules to properly use brackets and directions.

3. **Lines 115, 122, 124, and 133 Error**: Ensure that all characters used in levels or rules have corresponding definitions in the legend. The missing keys were addressed by fixing level designs and ensuring consistent notation.
