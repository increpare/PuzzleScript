### Changes Made
- **Sprite Dimensions:** Ensured all sprite graphics are 5x5 pixels.
- **Player Rules:** Fixed the rules to correctly handle player swapping and movement.
- **Legend and Targets:** Made sure that 'Tr' and 'Tb' are defined for the 'TargetRed' and 'TargetBlue' objects, ensuring corresponding symbols in levels are correctly referenced.
- **Level Layout and Symbols:** Ensured that all symbols used in levels are defined in the legend.

These changes should resolve the errors and make the game compile correctly.
