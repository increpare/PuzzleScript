### Changes Made:

1. Corrected the case of `NO` in the rules section to `no`, which is recognized by PuzzleScript to denote no objects.
2. Fixed capitalization issues with target indicators to match the legend:
   - Corrected `#T#` entries in the level layouts to `#Tr#` or `#Tb#`, instead of `#T#`, for proper target placement.
