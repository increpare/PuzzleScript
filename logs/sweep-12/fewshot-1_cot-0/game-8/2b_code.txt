**Corrections Made:**
1. Corrected the color name in the `Treasure` object definition.
2. Reduced the number of colors in the `Hero` object definition to reflect the actual number defined.
3. Fixed the levels to ensure they are rectangular by adding the necessary '#' characters.
4. Adjusted the rule for moving the player and hero to ensure the use of ellipses is correct.
