**Explanation of Fixes:**
1. For the `Treasure` object, I corrected the color specification by using simply `yellow` since the color "gold" was causing an error.

2. In the levels section, I ensured each row of the level map is of equal length to avoid errors about non-rectangular maps. They have been made consistently 9 characters wide.
