Explanation of changes:
1. The sound tokens were renamed from descriptive names (`Push`, `ButtonPressed`, `Move`) to generic names (`sfx0`, `sfx1`, etc.) as required by PuzzleScript syntax.
2. The WINCONDITIONS fixed to use "on" instead of "no" to correctly check that all Button objects have no overlapping Box.
3. Addressed a rule mismatch by ensuring patterns on both sides of the rule are of equal length and adapting the rule so it covers the expected behavior.
