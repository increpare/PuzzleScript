The errors in your code are due to incorrect color indexing in the sprite matrices for both the Barn and the Player. I will correct these errors by fixing the color indices being used. Here's the repaired code:

Key corrections:
- For `Barn`, the color indices were corrected by changing `1` to `0` and `3` to `0`, since there is only one color defined.
- For `Player`, there were extraneous characters in the sprite matrix which were corrected to match the single color index (`0`). 

This should address the compilation errors related to color indices and the sprite matrix format.
