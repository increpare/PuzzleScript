Here's a summary of the fixes:
1. Player sprite matrix was corrected to be 5x5 characters. Fixed lines 54 and 55 for the "Player" object.
2. Each pattern in the rules must have equivalent lengths on both sides. I've clarified line 95 to align with this requirement.
3. Made sure that there are no errors such as unexpected text after the '===' separator lines.
