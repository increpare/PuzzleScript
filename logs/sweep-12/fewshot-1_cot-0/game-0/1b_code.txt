This version corrects the sprite definitions for `Barn` and ensures proper use of colors. Specifically, the `Barn` object's art uses `1` and `3` instead of unsupported colors. The `Player` object's art has been correctly aligned with only 5 rows, both fixes aligning with PuzzleScript's sprite requirements.
