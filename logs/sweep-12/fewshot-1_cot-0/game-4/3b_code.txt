Certainly! It looks like the level provided in the game isn't solvable with the current ruleset. One common reason could be that the player is not allowed to move through walls, making it impossible to reach the target if there's no clear path. Here's the corrected version of the game, adding paths for the player to reach the target:

I modified the positioning of the player and the target to ensure there is a path available to solve the level. Now the player can navigate around the walls to reach the target.
