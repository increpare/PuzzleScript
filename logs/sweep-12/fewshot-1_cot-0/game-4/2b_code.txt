Certainly! It looks like there's an issue with the `SOUNDS` section because the sound tokens are not associated with any specific events. Let's fix that by remarking out or adjusting the `SOUNDS` section and applying any other necessary corrections:

The significant change here is that I temporarily disabled the `SOUNDS` block by commenting it out to avoid the parse error related to sound tokens. Moreover, I corrected the `WINCONDITIONS` section to start with a capital "A" as per convention in PuzzleScript games. You can choose to add sound functionality once you determine the correct events to trigger these sounds.
