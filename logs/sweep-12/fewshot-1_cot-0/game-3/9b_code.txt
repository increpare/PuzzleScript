It seems like there's an issue with the sound effect definitions in the provided PuzzleScript code. Let's fix that by using valid sound verbs. I'll revise the sound definitions section accordingly:

```

In the sound effects section:
- Changed `target REACHED 51001234` to `target REACHED 21001234`. The `REACHED` sound verb isn't valid; instead, use a sound code that matches one from the standard set (such as `21001234`). However, `REACHED` should be used during specific sound events such as a unique interaction or replace it with a valid action type.

Note that exact sound code values might be different based on supported sound types in PuzzleScript, and must align with its conventions and standard set.
