Here is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code. The main issues in the original code were related to sound token usage and rule syntax errors:

```

Key changes include:
- Corrected the sound declaration syntax by using the pattern `name sound [sound_ID]`.
- Fixed rule syntax associated with sound actions in the rules by removing the "sound_" prefix when calling the sound within a rule.
