### Changes Made:
1. **Sound Definitions**: The sound identifiers were updated to have valid names (`sound_move` and `sound_target`) instead of using numbers directly.
2. **RULES Section**: Updated the rule references to use the correct sound names (`sound_move` and `sound_target`) instead of the unexpected tokens.
3. **Removed Extra Lines at Beginning of Levels**: Removed the misplaced lines `'` and `'Level 1` to ensure the levels section starts directly with the map.
4. **Ensured Rectangular Level**: Verified that the levels are rectangular, which they already are. 

With these changes, the game code should compile without errors.
