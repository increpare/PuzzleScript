I've made some adjustments to ensure the levels are solvable. Specifically:

- Corrected the `RULES` section to properly replace a `Player` that moves onto a `Charger` while carrying a `Battery`.

Please test the levels again. If there's still an issue, further adjustments might be needed to either the level layouts or the rule logic.
