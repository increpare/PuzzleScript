Here's the corrected version of the code. The errors related to trying to access colors not defined in the color palette were fixed by modifying and correctly defining the colors for the sprites `Charger` and `Obstacle`.

In the `Charger`, I've corrected the digits to use only colors 0 and 1, which are the only colors defined. Similarly, for the `Obstacle`, only color 0 is used. This addresses the issue of accessing colors that don't exist in the palette.
