(My favourite set of sokoban levels - here're the first ten of the Microban set.

I tried contacting this guy, but he seems to have vanished from the net. The levels are in lots of places online, so I'm just chancing my arm by including them.  BUT BE WARNED.)

line 35 : Sprite graphics must be 5 wide and 5 high exactly.
line 68 : Rule matches object types that can't overlap: "CHARGER" and "PLAYER".
line 87 : CHARGER and PLAYER can never overlap, but this rule requires that to happen, so it's being culled.
