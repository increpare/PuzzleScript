Here is a repaired version of the code. The error messages indicate that there are incorrect color references for the Battery and Charger objects. The sprite definitions are adjusted to include the appropriate colors for each section:

This version includes the correct coloring definitions for the Battery and Charger objects to resolve the console errors noted. Additionally, I have ensured the game format is consistent, since there was no mention of changes needed in the game logic or layout definitions.
