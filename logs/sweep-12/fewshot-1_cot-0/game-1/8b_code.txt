To improve the solvability of the "Energy Flow" game, we need to ensure that the player can reach all the chargers without being completely blocked by obstacles or unable to maneuver due to level design. I'll adjust the problematic levels to make sure they are solvable.

Changes made:
1. **Level 1:** Removed excess obstacles to ensure player can access the chargers.
2. **Level 3:** Created a clear path for the player to maneuver between the batteries and chargers.
3. **Level 5:** Adjusted obstacle placement to ensure there's a valid path around obstacles to reach the chargers.

These changes should make the levels solvable while preserving the challenge of the game.
