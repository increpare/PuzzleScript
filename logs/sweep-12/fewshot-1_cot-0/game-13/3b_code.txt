Changes Made:
1. Fixed the `Player` sprite color legend discrepancies to match what should be intended while correcting technical errors with palette indices.
2. Addressed the error with the rule `[ Player Hive ]` which was culled due to logical impossibility (adjustment suggestion provided). 
3. Corrected the win condition to something that properly reflects reaching goal or removing items from game board.
