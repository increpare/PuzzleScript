The errors in your original PuzzleScript code are due to incorrect palette definitions for the "Player", "Flower", and "Hive" objects. Each sprite should only use color indices that are part of their respective color palettes. Here's a corrected version of your code:

**Changes made:**

1. **Flower Object**: Changed the `2` to `1` and kept `red` and `green` in the color palette.
2. **Hive Object**: Adjusted to use `1` for `orange` and `0` for `yellow` in the palette.
3. Corrected any unnecessary usages of color indices which were not defined in the object's palette.

This should fix your errors related to palette indices.
