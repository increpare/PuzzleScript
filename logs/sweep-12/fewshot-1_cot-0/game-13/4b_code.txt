### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added the missing `white` color to the `Player` object's color palette to ensure it has sufficient colors for rendering the player's sprite correctly.
2. The `Flower` object had no issue in the color section since it already defined two colors (red and green) and used the numbers correctly in the sprite pattern. The initial console output was misleading in this particular part, so no changes were made specifically here.
