Below is the repaired version of the code that addresses the errors. The errors were due to incorrect coloring access in the Wall and Treasure's sprite definitions. The Wall had incorrect references to a nonexistent third color, and the Treasure was attempting to use two colors despite only defining one. The code has been adjusted accordingly.

The modifications made involved addressing the inappropriate color index references so that all specified indices correspond to actual colors within their respective sprites.
