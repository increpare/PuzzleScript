Here's a repaired version of the code for your PuzzleScript game "Treasure Hunt". I focused on addressing the errors related to the undefined sounds, missing legend entries, and issues with map shapes.

Here are the corrections made:

1. Replaced the sound identifier `collectTreasure` with `SFX0` for a valid sound name.
2. Removed unused legend entries `TR` and `PL` because they were not needed in the code.
3. Adjusted LEVEL 1 to ensure all rows have the same length.
4. Used consistent naming for sound and game components.
