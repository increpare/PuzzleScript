Certainly! The issue seems to stem from the comments you've added that begin with `# LEVEL X` for the levels, which PuzzleScript interprets as part of the level data due to incorrect formatting of the levels. Additionally, the levels themselves are not properly rectangular, and there's also a stray `....` in level 1 that seems to be intended as a separator rather than level data.

Let's address these errors by removing those comments, fixing the level maps to have consistent widths, and ensuring game objects are correctly defined and referenced.

Here's a corrected version of your game script:

### Key Changes:
- **Removed Level Comments and Separators:** PuzzleScript does not understand level comments or separators; everything needs to be part of a consistent map representation.
- **Rectangular Levels Fixes:** Ensured every level line in the maps has the same width. Level 1 seemed to have `.......` line, which I've removed to maintain rectangular integrity.
- **Legend Consistency:** Verified that all objects are correctly defined and matched the legend symbols to objects. 

Please test this corrected version in your PuzzleScript environment.
