Here is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. I've resolved the reported errors by ensuring the level key specifications are correct and that the maps are rectangular:

I ensured every row in each level is the same length to adhere to the requirement of rectangular maps. The errors concerning unidentified keys were due to the accidental interpretation of your comments as part of the level input, so I updated the code to ensure these identifiers do not appear within the level specifications.
