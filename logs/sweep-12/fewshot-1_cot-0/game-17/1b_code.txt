The errors in the console output are due to the incorrect color definitions for the `Player` and `Star` objects. Specifically, the code attempts to use indexed colors that are not defined, resulting in errors. Below is a corrected version of the game code:

```

In this version, the color index `1` for both `Player` and `Star` was replaced with index `0`, which corresponds to the first (and only) color defined for each of these objects. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
