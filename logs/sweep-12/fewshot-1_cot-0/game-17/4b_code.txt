```

### Changes Made:
1. **Order of Sections**: Added an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`, as PuzzleScript requires all section headings, even if they are not used.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Ensured that object names in rules and win conditions are capitalized as they are defined (e.g., `Player`, `Star`).
3. **Rule Correction**: Ensured the rule `[ Player | Star ] -> [ Player ]` has matching case for `Player` and `Star` to avoid errors.

Now the script should compile and run without errors.
