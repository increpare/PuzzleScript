### Explanation:
1. **Player Color Definition**: The PLAYER object initially had a syntax error with the color list. Ensure each color is defined clearly. Here I added `black` as a secondary color in the PLAYER to match the implied intention in the sprite design.

2. **Sound Syntax**: The `picksound` and `dousesound` tokens were incorrect. Replaced them with correct sound identifiers `sfx0` and `sfx1` as per PuzzleScript's sound command syntax, corresponding to each desired sound action. 

3. **Water Definition**: Added `black` as a secondary color in Water's palette for continuity and possible errors.

With these modifications, the game script should compile and run correctly.
