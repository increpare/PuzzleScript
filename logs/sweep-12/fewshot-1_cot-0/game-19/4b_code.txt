**Corrections Made:**

1. **Player Object:**
   - Modified the `Player` object's color palette from `lime white black` to `lime black`. References to "color number 2" which didnâ€™t exist were adjusted as well.

2. **Water Object:**
   - Replaced `blue cyan` with just `blue` to ensure water has a single color defined in its palette.

With these changes, the errors regarding color definitions should be resolved.
