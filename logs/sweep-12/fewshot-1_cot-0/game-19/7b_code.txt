I have corrected the error by ensuring that the object definitions for 'Player' correctly specify two colors in the palette instead of mistakenly indicating "lime ", which caused misunderstanding due to the unnecessary space. The color names should be followed directly by another color without extra spaces, ensuring PuzzleScript can correctly interpret them.
