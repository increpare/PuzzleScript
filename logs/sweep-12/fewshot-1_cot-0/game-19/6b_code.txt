### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Player Color Definition:** Fixed the `Player` object color by adding two colors: `lime black`. Each sprite needs to have a defined color for each layer used in its design.  

2. **Corrected Rule with Sound Command:** The sound command `sfx1` was placed inside the rule definition rather than at the end of the rule. Moved the sound to the proper end position outside the condition pattern and replacement pattern to follow PuzzleScript syntax.
