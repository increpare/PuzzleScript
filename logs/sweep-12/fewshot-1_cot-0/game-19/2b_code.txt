Changes made:
- Added "black" to the Player's color palette to match the number of color indices used in the sprite.
- Adjusted Water's sprite to avoid accessing more colors than defined. Specifically, I corrected the sprite definition pattern for Water by keeping it consistent with the color index range provided.
