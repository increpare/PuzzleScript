left [ LeftBeam | < Player ] -> [ LeftBeam | Player ]
right [ RightBeam | < Player ] -> [ RightBeam | Player ]
up [ UpBeam | < Player ] -> [ UpBeam | Player ]
down [ DownBeam | < Player ] -> [ DownBeam | Player ]

right [ RightBeam | stationary Pushable ] -> [ RightBeam | > Pushable ]

[ Beam ] -> []


[ >  Player | Crate ] -> [  >  Player | > Crate  ]

( using red/greypushable is an optimization - cuts down on unecessary rules by quite a lot, beause red and grey things never coexist)

[ > RedPushable | ^ RedPushable ] -> [ RedPushable | ^ RedPushable ]

[ > GreyPushable | ^ GreyPushable ] -> [ GreyPushable | ^ GreyPushable ]
[ > GreyPushable | < GreyPushable ] -> [ GreyPushable | < GreyPushable ]
