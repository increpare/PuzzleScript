Notes on changes made:
1. Fixed the `Wall` sprite's color palette by adding necessary spaces to allow three colors.
2. Removed the erroneous `[startlevel]` and `[model]` references from the `RULES` section.
3. Updated the sound token for the enemy's movement to match its definitionâ€”changed `enemysound` to `enemymove`.
4. Added an `endlevel` sound to play when the player reaches an exit.
