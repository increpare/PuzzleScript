### Changes Made:
1. Updated the `Wall` object to have a correct pattern using the defined color.
2. Removed the `enemymove` sound since it was not correctly defined or used.
3. In the rules section, replaced `endlevel` with `win` to properly end the level when the `Player` reaches the `Exit`.
4. Removed the `enemymove` sound reference in the rules since it's not defined.
