Here's a repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the errors mentioned in the console output:

Key changes made:
- In the LEGEND section, I replaced `=` with `.` to define the Background object correctly.
- Adjusted the RULES for box movement to include separators using the pipe symbol `|` more appropriately, and corrected the error with object positioning to ensure no Wall where a Box can be pushed to.
- Changed the sample level design from "....." to "...." since no map should see more than five playable square tiles.
