Below is a repaired version of the PuzzleScript code, correcting the issues with the wall color palette and the format issue with the `LEGEND` section. Additionally, I've ensured the Box movement rules will work appropriately within the context of the collision layers.

I've corrected the errors:

1. **Fixed Wall Color Definition**: Removed extra numbers, as the wall doesn't need multiple colors if it's only represented by transparency (used "." for placeholders).

2. **Addressed LEGEND Section Format**: Ensured the Legend section has correct entries with appropriate mappings.

3. **Positioned Layers Correctly**: `Wall` should be placed above `Player` in the collision layers to prevent players from moving through walls, assuming Wall should be solid and immovable.

This should allow your game to compile and function correctly, assuming the intended behavior is for the player to push the box onto the target, with walls acting as obstacles. If you have any specific game rules you'd like to enforce or any additional logic needed, those parts can also be updated.
