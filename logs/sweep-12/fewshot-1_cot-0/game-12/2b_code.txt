The errors in your code can be addressed by ensuring that the Wall object has the correct color palette with five color entries as shown in other objects, and adding the missing "SOUNDS" section even if empty. Additionally, verifying that each object correctly defines its graphic representation can prevent issues related to accessing undefined colors. Here's the repaired version of your code:
