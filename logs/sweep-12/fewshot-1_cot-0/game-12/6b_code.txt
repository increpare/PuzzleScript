Here is the repaired version of the code. I've addressed the errors you encountered by modifying the relevant parts of the game description:

In the code above, I've fixed the player's movement rules by using specific directions like `right`, `left`, `up`, and `down`, as opposed to using symbols outside of square brackets. I also removed the incorrect comments after the `SOUNDS` section header, which was causing a parsing issue. Additionally, I ensured that all object keys and rules are correctly implemented without referring to nonexistent objects or legends.
