### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Line 52 and Similar Errors**: These errors about lines with '===' and comments are usually due to formatting issues or misplaced comments. 
2. **Rule Syntax Errors (lines 74 and 80)**: The error in movement rules means an incorrect syntax was used. Box movements should check for walls.
3. **Key "." Error**: The level definition was using dots '.' for empty spaces but wasn't defined in the legend. Fixed by ensuring Background is used correctly in both levels and objects. The dot symbol should represent the Background.

By correcting these syntax issues and ensuring the rules are appropriately checking conditions (like walls), the PuzzleScript game should compile and function as expected.
