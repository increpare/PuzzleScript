Here are the changes made:
- Added the "SOUNDS" section to comply with the required order of sections.
- Corrected how the rules refer to objects to include a space after directional symbols, ensuring that syntax aligns with PuzzleScript conventions.
- Removed the erroneous 'Name "#" does not exist' issue, which was a result of not using the Wall object label properly in the rules, though it wasn't needed in this particular set of rules.
- Confirmed that object names and their references are consistent (e.g., using "Player" instead of lowercase variations).

This corrected code should compile without the errors you experienced.
