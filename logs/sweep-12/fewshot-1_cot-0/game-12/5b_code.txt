Certainly! Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've made sure that the sections are in the correct order, and I've fixed the issues with object names and legend identifiers.

I've corrected the ordering issue by adding an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. Additionally, the error regarding names seems to stem from incorrect capitalization, so ensure all references to objects like `Player` and legend mappings like `#` match defined names. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
