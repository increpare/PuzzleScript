Certainly! The errors detected relate to improper marker usage, missing definitions, and incorrect rule formations. Here's the revised code:

Changes made:
1. Corrected the `LEGEND` section to substitute `=` with `Background`.
2. Adjusted the `COLLISIONLAYERS` based on corrected legend symbols.
3. Removed unnecessary use of `#` and `movement` in rule definitions.
4. Cleaned up the levels by removing the incorrect use of '/' for level boundaries.

This should resolve the errors, and the game should compile correctly now.
