The order of the sections in a PuzzleScript game is important. The `Objects` section should come before the `Legend` section because you need to define the objects before you use them in the legend. Here's the corrected version of the code:

===========
Objects
===========
Background
grey

Wall
orange

Player
yellow

Box
blue

Target
red

BoxOnTarget
green

===========
Legend
===========
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

===========
Sounds
===========
# No custom sounds specified.

Background

Player, Box, BoxOnTarget, Wall

WinConditions
===========
All BoxOnTarget on Target

===========
Rules
===========
[ > Player |  ] -> [ > Player | > ]
[ Player | Box  ] -> [ > Player | > Box  ]
[ Player | BoxOnTarget  ] -> [ > Player | > BoxOnTarget  ]

[ Player | Box on Target ] -> [ > Player | > BoxOnTarget ]

Box -> > | BoxOnTarget on Target
BoxOnTarget -> > | Box not on Target

```

Now, the `Objects` section is at the beginning, followed by the `Legend` section. This should resolve the errors you encountered.
