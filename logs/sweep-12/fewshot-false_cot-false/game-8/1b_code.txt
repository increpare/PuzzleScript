The errors you're encountering are due to incorrect section headers. In PuzzleScript, section headers like "Title", "Author", and "Homepage" should use a single line header format without additional styling or equal signs. I'll replace them with the correct metadata format in the prelude. Here's the corrected code:

```plaintext
Title Simple Sokoban
Author Game Designer
Homepage https://www.example.com

===========
Legend
===========
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target
G = BoxOnTarget

===========
Sounds
===========
# No custom sounds specified.

===========
CollisionLayers
===========
Background
Target
Player, Box, BoxOnTarget, Wall

===========
Objects
===========
Background
grey

Wall
orange

Player
yellow

Box
blue

Target
red

BoxOnTarget
green

===========
Legend ends
===========

===========
WinConditions
===========
All BoxOnTarget on Target

===========
Rules
===========
[ > Player |  ] -> [ > Player | > ]
[ Player | Box  ] -> [ > Player | > Box  ]
[ Player | BoxOnTarget  ] -> [ > Player | > BoxOnTarget  ]

[ Player | Box on Target ] -> [ > Player | > BoxOnTarget ]

Box -> > | BoxOnTarget on Target
BoxOnTarget -> > | Box not on Target 

===========
Levels

#...#

```

This version should compile without errors by correcting the metadata and ensuring proper section headers are used. The equal signs are not required in PuzzleScript descriptions.
