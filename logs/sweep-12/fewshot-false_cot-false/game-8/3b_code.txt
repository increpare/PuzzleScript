The errors in the code need to be addressed by modifying the rules and fixing the syntax issues. Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

### Explanation:
1. **Order of Sections**: Rearranged the `WinConditions` section to be after `Rules`.
   
2. **Rules Syntax**: Corrected the rules to properly transform `Box` into `BoxOnTarget` when it is pushed onto a `Target`. Removed invalid positional syntax and inappropriate use of `on`.

3. **Object Usage**: Adjusted the rule statements to ensure objects are correctly defined within square brackets.

4. **Rule Fixes**: Changed the syntax for rules involving `Box` and `BoxOnTarget` to ensure they reference correct transformations and interactions with `Target`.

This corrected version should compile without errors.
