To fix the errors in the given PuzzleScript game code, make sure all object colors are defined with single color names, ensure sections are in the correct order, and confirm that object names in rules use correct case sensitivity. Here's the corrected code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Colors Definitions**: Changed `cyan` to `blue` and `magenta` to `red` to match the format (since PuzzleScript supports its predefined colors).
2. **Section Order**: Added an empty `SOUNDS` section before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` as required by the puzzle script structure.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The rules now correctly use object names with proper capitalization (e.g., `P` and `B` instead of `p` and `b`).

This revised version should address the compilation errors and work as intended.
