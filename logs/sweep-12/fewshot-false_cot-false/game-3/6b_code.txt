Here is the corrected PuzzleScript code. I've adjusted the rules so that each rule has an equal number of cells on both the left and right sides of the pattern, and I've included a placeholder sound event for the sound section to resolve the sound-related error.

This version should resolve the syntax issues noted in the console output by ensuring each rule pattern is balanced and incorporating a placeholder sound event.
