Key corrections:
- Corrected object color specification for `BoxOnTarget` and `PusherOnTarget` by ensuring the colors were correctly typed.
- Fixed sound tokens by correcting their syntax under the `SOUNDS` section.
- In the `RULES` section, ensured direction actions apply properly to objects, and matched correct patterns on both left and right sides of the rules.
- Ensured `PUSH` sound is properly called with movements instead of associated directly with rules without actions.
- Placed `WINCONDITIONS` more accurately, using the shorthand `O` which is set in the `LEGEND` for `BoxOnTarget`.
- Reordered some rules to ensure proper sequence of state changes where needed.

These changes should help resolve the errors and have the game function correctly.
