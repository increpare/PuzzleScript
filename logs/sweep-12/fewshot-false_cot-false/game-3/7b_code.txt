To fix the errors in your PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Sound Seed Error**: Replace `SFX0` in the `SOUNDS` section with a valid sound seed, which is a number (e.g., `123456`).

2. **Unequal Rule Pattern Length**: Ensure that every rule has a matching pattern on both sides with the same number of cells. Specifically, look for a rule that does not maintain this symmetry.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

Key changes include removing the ambiguous rule `[ BoxOnTarget | Target] -> [ Box | Target]` because it was not symmetrical in its intended context and could cause issues. The game should compile without errors now. Make sure to test thoroughly for the desired behavior!
