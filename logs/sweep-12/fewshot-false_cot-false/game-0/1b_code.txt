The errors you're encountering are due to missing colons after the metadata headers (`Title`, `Author`, `Homepage`). These should be followed by a colon ':' to properly define them as key-value pairs. I'll correct these issues for you:

```plaintext
===========
title: 
===========
Catch the Star

===========
author: 
===========
Your Name

===========
homepage: 
===========
www.example.com

===========
legend
===========
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
* = Star

===========
sounds
===========
# Sound specifications can go here

===========
collisionLayers
===========
Background
Player, Star, Wall

===========
rules
===========

[Player | Star] -> [Player Star]

===========
winconditions
===========
All Star on Player

===========

With these corrections, your code should compile correctly. The colons after `title`, `author`, and `homepage` ensure that the metadata is properly formatted.
