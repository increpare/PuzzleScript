The errors you are seeing are due to missing values for the metadata sections "title," "author," and "homepage." Each of these sections needs a value on the same line as the section identifier. I will fill these out with example values to make the code work. Additionally, any comments should be removed or placed after a valid section to avoid "unrecognized stuff in the prelude" errors.

This version should compile properly. Now, the metadata sections directly follow the section identifier with no line breaks or extra lines in between the identifier and the value.
