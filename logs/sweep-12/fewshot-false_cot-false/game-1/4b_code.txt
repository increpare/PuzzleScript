The errors you're experiencing are due to the incorrect formatting and section divider usage in the prelude of your PuzzleScript code. The section dividers `========` were expected only once per section and misplaced in the prelude parts (title, author, homepage). Here's a corrected version of your code:

```plaintext

I have fixed the errors by placing the metadata values, such as the title, author, and homepage, directly after their respective keywords. This should resolve the issues during the compilation of your game.
