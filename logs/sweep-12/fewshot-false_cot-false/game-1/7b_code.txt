### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Sprite Dimensions:** All sprites are now 5x5. Fixed lines (Background, Player, Crate, Wall).
2. **Colors for Background:** Added five empty rows for the `Background` object.
3. **Sound Declarations:** Moved sounds directly within the rules using `sound SFX` notation.
4. **Collision Needs Target "|"**: Added `|` to indicate the additional layers in the `RULES` to maintain the space correctly.
5. **Level Rectangularity:** Adjusted the layout of each level to ensure all rows have consistent length. Removed unnecessary `#` characters or added them where necessary.
6. **Space Symbol:** Removed spaces from levels; replaced the ' ' space object with an implied empty space allowing levels to be rectangular.
This code should now compile without errors.
