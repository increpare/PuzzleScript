The errors you encountered are related to some formatting issues in the PuzzleScript game code. Let's correct those errors by making sure that each section follows the correct syntax. Here is the fixed version of the game code:

```

Changes made:
- Made sure each section (OBJECTS, LEGEND, SOUNDS, COLLISIONLAYERS, RULES, WINCONDITIONS, LEVELS) is correctly enclosed starting and ending with "======== =" instead of "========= " (correct number of characters for lines to align properly).
- Double-checked each section for correct syntax and alignment. 

This should resolve the parsing errors and allow your PuzzleScript game to compile successfully.
