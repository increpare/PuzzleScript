The error messages indicate that there's an issue with the length of patterns in the rule definitions. Each pattern on the left side of a rule should match the length of the pattern on the right side. Here's your corrected code with properly matched patterns in the rules:

In the fixed rules, each pattern now has the same number of cells on both sides of the transformation arrow `->`. This resolves the compilation errors and makes the patterns correctly defined.
