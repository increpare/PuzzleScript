Changes made to address the errors:

1. Fixed the sound definition. Changed `FoundTreasure` to `Collision` and changed `P Moved Treasure:` to `Player Moved Treasure:` while using the correct case for `trebleup`.

2. Ensured the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is correctly ordered before `RULES`.

3. Fixed the rule for clearing the goal; changed `[]` to `[Goal]`. This ensures that the player will leave the goal intact, but effectively be removed from it.

These fixes should resolve the errors reported by the compiler and allow the game to function as intended.
