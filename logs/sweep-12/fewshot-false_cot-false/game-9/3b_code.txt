The errors you're encountering relate to the incorrect palette definition for the `Treasure` object and issues in the `SOUNDS` section of your code. Here's a fixed version of your PuzzleScript game code:

**Fixes applied:**
1. Corrected the color data for the `Treasure` object to ensure it uses the correct pattern with distinct colors that align with the object definition.
2. Fixed the `SOUNDS` section to properly match syntax and triggering conditions. The original sound configuration was incorrect and needed specifying a sound action verb (e.g., `Moved`) followed by the triggering conditions and the sound effect (e.g., `trebleUp`).
