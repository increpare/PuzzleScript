Here is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. I've adjusted the syntax errors and modified the rules according to the PuzzleScript engine's requirements.

Key changes made:
1. Corrected the `SOUNDS` section syntax: `Player Move Treasure trebleup`.
2. Fixed the syntax issue in the rules section (removed unnecessary tokens "// clear goal to advance"). 
3. Reformulated the second rule to correct syntax.
