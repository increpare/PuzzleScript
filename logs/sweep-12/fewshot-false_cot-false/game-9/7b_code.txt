Below is the repaired version of the PuzzleScript code. The issues have been addressed:

1. Corrected the sound syntax by using a sound seed instead of "trebleup".
2. Fixed the rules to match the pattern length on both sides.

Changes made:
1. For the sound, I replaced "trebleup" with "1" to properly define the sound seed.
2. In the rules, I ensured the right side of `[> Player | Treasure] -> [Goal]` to maintain consistent pattern lengths between the left and right sides of the rule.
