The issue reported by the console is that the game is trying to use indexed colors that are not defined within the color palette of each sprite. In PuzzleScript, each object is supposed to be initialized with a set of colors, and the patterns thereafter refer to these colors by their index.

Letâ€™s correct the color definitions to use a consistent pattern where all elements of the `OBJECTS` section are initialized correctly, and all color definitions within the sprites match.

I have ensured that each sprite's pattern correctly uses the defined color index. Now the console shouldn't show any errors related to color indexing. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
