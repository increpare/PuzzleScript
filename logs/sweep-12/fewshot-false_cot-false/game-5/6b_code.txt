Certainly! Let's address the errors one by one:

1. **Unknown junk in object section:** This suggests incorrect entries in the OBJECTS section; the sprite dimensions might be off or incorrectly formatted.

2. **Expecting a sound event or an object name:** If there's an SFX event mentioned in the rules that isn't defined, it'll cause this issue.

3. **Patterns in rules must correspond:** Each side of a rule must have the same number of entities.

Here's the corrected code:

### Changes Made:

- Adjusted the `Target` and `BlockOnTarget` sprites to ensure each sprite is exactly 5x5.
- Added the `SFX2` in the SOUNDS section since it's being used in the rules.
- Fixed the rule patterns for `[Block | Target]` and `[BlockOnTarget | Target]` to ensure equal length on both sides.
