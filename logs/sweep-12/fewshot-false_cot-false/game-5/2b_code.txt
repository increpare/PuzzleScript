The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code indicate that there's an issue with accessing color palette indices that are out of bounds. This is likely because the `Player` and `Block` objects are defined with only one color, but you're attempting to reference additional colors that haven't been defined.

Let's repair the code by ensuring that each object uses colors within their defined palette, based on the expected shapes described.

Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

```

In this updated code, the `Player` and `Block` objects have been adjusted so that their patterns only use the defined color index (`1`). This should resolve the console output errors related to undefined colors.
