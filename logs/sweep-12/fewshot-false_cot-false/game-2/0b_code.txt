### Explanation:

- **Objects:** Defines the objects in the game: `Background`, `Wall`, `Player`, and `Gem`.
  
- **Legend:** Defines the characters for each object in levels: `.` for `Background`, `#` for `Wall`, `P` for `Player`, and `G` for `Gem`.

- **CollisionLayers:** Layering order for object rendering. The player and gem are on top of the wall in this case.

- **Rules:** Interactive behaviors:
  - Basic movement rules to allow the player to move in all four directions.
  - A rule triggers the collection of the gem when the `Player` moves onto the same tile as the `Gem`.

- **WinConditions:** Specifies the game-winning condition, which is collecting all gems.

- **Levels:** Two levels are defined, with walls, a player start position, and a gem to collect.

This simple game provides a basic framework for working with PuzzleScript while engaging players in collecting gems and avoiding obstacles. Adjust the ASCII level maps and rules to create new challenges and expand gameplay!
