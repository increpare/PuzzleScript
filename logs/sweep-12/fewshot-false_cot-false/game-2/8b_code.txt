Sure, I'll provide a corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. Let's address the errors mentioned:

1. **Sound Placeholder Error:** The comment about how to define placeholders or optional sound references can be removed as it is unnecessary.

2. **Movement Rules Error:** The rule format is incorrect. Movement rules should define what happens when the player moves in a direction, not using a separate notation for directions.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

Explanation of Corrections:
- Removed unnecessary comments in the **SOUNDS** section.
- Corrected the movement rules to correctly use the syntax of PuzzleScript where you'll bind actions to specific states. No explicit comments are needed for directions within the rules.
- The rule format for movement was simplified to replace objects in brackets correctly, conforming to how PuzzleScript rulesets are structured.
  
This updated script should now compile without errors and function as expected.
