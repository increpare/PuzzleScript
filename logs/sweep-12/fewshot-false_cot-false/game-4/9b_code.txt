Certainly! The errors you've encountered are due to some mistakes with capitalization, missing required sections, and formatting. Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

Changes made:
- Added the `SOUNDS` section, even though it's empty, to maintain correct section order.
- Corrected object names to `P` and `G` in both `RULES` and `WINCONDITIONS` to match the defined legend.
- Removed additional equals signs (`=`) in between sections to prevent errors.
