### Explanation:

- **Title, Author, Homepage**: Basic game details to identify the game.
  
- **Objects**: 
  - *Background* is defined as `LIGHTGREEN`.
  - *Player* is a blue object.
  - *Goal* is a yellow object.

- **Legend**: Defines symbols used in the level design.
  
- **CollisionLayers**: Establishes object layers. Objects listed on the same line can't overlap each other.

- **Rules**: Defines interactions. Here, when the Player overlaps the Goal, it stays on it.

- **WinConditions**: The player wins when all Goal objects have a Player on them.

- **Levels**: Two simple levels are defined:
  - Level 1 starts with the Player near the Goal.
  - Level 2 has a different arrangement, requiring movement to reach the Goal.

This code sets up a basic game where you control a player to move to the goal. You can expand it with more levels and additional rules for added complexity.
