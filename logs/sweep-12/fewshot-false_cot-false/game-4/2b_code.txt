Certainly! The errors mentioned in the console output indicate issues with the syntax, sprite definitions, and rule definitions. I'll correct the errors and provide a repaired version of the code:

1. The sprite matrix uses invalid characters apart from '.', which should be the pixel on (use '1') and off (use '.').
2. The incorrect use of "on" in the rule needs to be corrected.
   
Here is the corrected version:

Key Changes Made:

- The Player sprite now uses '1' for the blue pixels instead of 'o'.
- Replaced `[ Player on Goal ]` in the rule with `[ Player Goal ]`.
- Adjusted the goal rule to remove reference to 'on', ensuring they apply correctly for the format used in PuzzleScript.

This should address the problems and facilitate proper compilation and execution of the game.
