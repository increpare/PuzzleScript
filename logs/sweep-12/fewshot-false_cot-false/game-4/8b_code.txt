To address the errors in your PuzzleScript game code, the following modifications have been made:

1. Ensure equals signs are not followed by anything on the same line unless it's a specific section divider.
2. Removed an unnecessary section (`SOUNDS`), keeping it empty since it doesn't impact functionality unless sounds are added.
3. Fix the LEVELS section to match the expected format within PuzzleScript, ensuring proper specification of levels and filling the map fully to be rectangular.

Here's the corrected version of your game code:

Changes include:

- Ensured that the sections marked with `======` are not followed by comments or other text.
- Ensured that the levels are laid out such that each row is the same length and defined in the correct section.
