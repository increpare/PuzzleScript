Here is a revised version of the code that addresses the errors related to the sprite matrix and other sections mentioned in the console output. The main issues were related to incorrect definitions of sprite graphics and some formatting problems. Let's fix them:

```

The corrections include:
- Ensuring that each sprite is exactly 5x5 in the object definition.
- The `TreasureOnGoal` object now has a correctly specified color.
