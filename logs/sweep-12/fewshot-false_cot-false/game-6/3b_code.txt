Certainly! The error messages pointed out several issues in your original PuzzleScript code. Let's address them one by one:

1. The sprite matrices for objects should be 5x5, using the intended design with `.` to fill remaining spaces.
2. The color "limegreen" should be split into two separate words: "lime green".
3. The `END` keyword is not needed and leading to confusion. It should be removed.
4. Ensure there is no additional junk between the sprite lines.

Here is the corrected code:

This corrected version should compile without errors and run as expected.
