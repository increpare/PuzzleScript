The errors in your PuzzleScript game code are caused by a few issues: the sound system isn't correctly set up in PuzzleScript, and the wall character "#" isn't defined in the legend. Here's the repaired version of the code:

I've removed the sound section since PuzzleScript + PS Classic doesn't currently support defining custom sounds directly in the script, and added the wall "#" to the Legend section. Ensure to add the wall definition so that the game recognizes "#" as the wall character.
