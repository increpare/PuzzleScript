Here's a corrected version of the PuzzleScript code. I've addressed the issues with object definitions, sprite sizes, and order of sections. The error messages were likely due to incorrect formatting of object definitions or legend mappings. I've also ensured all sections are in the correct order and complete:

Changes made:
1. Fixed sprite definitions to be 5x5 as required by PuzzleScript.
2. Corrected object and legend definitions; ensured unique mapping of symbols.
3. Added a Player object to the legend with the key 'P'.
4. Added the Goal object key 'G' to the legend.
5. Ensured the WINCONDITIONS section is included and correctly placed before LEVELS.
6. Corrected level maps to use defined symbols from the legend (replacing '@' with 'P', replacing '.' usage for Goal with 'G', etc.).
