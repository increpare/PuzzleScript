To address the issues in your PuzzleScript code, I've made corrections based on the errors provided. The changes I made include:

1. Ensuring sprite matrices are exactly 5x5.
2. Properly formatting object color names like "lime green" without extra spaces.
3. Adjusting rule definitions for consistent pattern matching.
4. Clarifying and fixing spacing in the level maps.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```

Key adjustments:
- Ensured all sprites are exactly 5x5 pixels.
- Removed extra space in color name "lime green" to "limegreen".
- Fixed the rule signature `[ | Player | Treasure]` to `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | Treasure]` (consistent pattern and repetition on both sides of the rule).
- Updated map errors, particularly mapping space characters if needed, as per PuzzleScript's specifications and corrected spaces.
  
You can now try running the revised code in PuzzleScript.
