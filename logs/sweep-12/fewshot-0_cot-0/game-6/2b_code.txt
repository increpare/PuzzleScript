Certainly! Based on the errors you've mentioned, it seems there are a few issues related to the sprite matrices, object definitions, and potentially some text in the file's structure. I've corrected the code to address these errors by ensuring that all objects have 5x5 sprite matrices filled with valid characters and corrected any unexpected text in sections. Also, the incorrect color "lime" in "TreasureOnGoal" was replaced with a valid CSS color.

Here is the corrected code:
