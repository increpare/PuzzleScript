Certainly! Here is a revised version of your PuzzleScript code. I've corrected the sprite matrix issues, fixed object definitions, specified all necessary colors, and ensured consistent rule structure.

Key Changes:
- Ensured all sprites are 5x5 pixels.
- Specified color for all objects including `TreasureOnGoal`.
- Adjusted the rules to ensure matching lengths for left and right pattern configurations.
- Cleaned up formatting for clarity.
