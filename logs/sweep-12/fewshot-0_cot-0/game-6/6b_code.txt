Below is the corrected PuzzleScript code. The main issues to be addressed involved ensuring the sprite matrices are exactly 5x5 and fixing the rule mismatch. Additionally, spaces defined in the map sections have been corrected to correspond to the defined objects.

**Corrections made:**
1. Adjusted every sprite matrix to be exactly 5x5 in size as required.
2. Fixed the rule mismatch by ensuring each pattern on the left has a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length.
3. Replaced spaces in the level definitions with dots (Background) to match the defined legend symbols.
