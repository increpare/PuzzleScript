In this game:

- The player (`P`) can push treasure (`$`) into goals (`.`).
- Goals can become occupied by treasure (`TreasureOnGoal`, represented as `$`).
- The objective is to position all treasure into the goal areas to win the game, in true Sokoban fashion.
- The levels provide different setups for increasing difficulty. Adjust the levels section or add more rules to expand the game's complexity.
