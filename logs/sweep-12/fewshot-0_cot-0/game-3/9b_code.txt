To address the error in the original code, you need to ensure that the patterns on the left and right sides of each rule have an equal number of cells. It looks like there's a mismatch in one of the rules. Here's the corrected version of the code:

The crucial fix here is that all rule patterns on the left and right sides now have corresponding numbers of cells. This change resolves the mismatch that was causing the compilation error.
