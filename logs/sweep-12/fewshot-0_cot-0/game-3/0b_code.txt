Here is a brief overview of the game elements:

- **OBJECTS** section defines various elements within the game like the pusher, boxes, walls, targets, etc.
- **LEGEND** maps characters used in the level designs to their respective objects.
- **SOUNDS** specifies sound effects for actions.
- **COLLISIONLAYERS** indicates which objects can interact on different layers.
- **RULES** define the game's mechanics when a player interacts with specific objects.
- **WINCONDITIONS** describe the goal for completing a level, such as getting all boxes onto targets.
- **LEVELS** section contains designs of different stages where the player navigates to achieve the win condition. 

This setup creates a basic "Sokoban" style game where the player must correctly push boxes onto target spaces to win.
