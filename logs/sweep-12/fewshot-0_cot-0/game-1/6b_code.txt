It looks like there are some formatting issues in your PuzzleScript game code. Let's clean up the sections so the game can compile correctly. Notably, ensure that section headers (`OBJECTS`, `LEGEND`, `SOUNDS`, `COLLISIONLAYERS`, `RULES`, `WINCONDITIONS`, `LEVELS`) are clearly defined and not commented after, which should resolve the errors you were encountering.

Here's the corrected code:

In this corrected version, each section header is clearly labeled without additional non-commented text on the same line, ensuring proper recognition by the PuzzleScript compiler.
