Let's address the errors reported in the console output and fix the code.

Here is the revised version of the game code:

### Revisions Made:

1. **Sound Specification:** I removed the sound rules `[Crate Target] -> [Crate Target | sound SFX1]` and `[ > Player | Target ] -> [ > Player | Target | sound SFX2]` since they referenced non-existent sound events as "sound" is not defined. The game description initially intended to play sounds on certain actions, but the sound functionality might be misused in the rule syntax without proper sound definitions.

2. **Whitespace Usage in Levels:** Removed unnecessary spaces in the level design to match correctly with defined objects/characters. Spaces do not correspond to any object in the "LEGEND" section.

3. **Placeholder for Sounds:** While leaving sounds as placeholders, I've named two potential sound effects in the "SOUNDS" section (`SFX1`, `SFX2`). 

With these adjustments, the game code should compile correctly. Note that the sound functionality would still need to be implemented correctly within the rules if required in the future.
