Sure! The errors in the original code are primarily due to missing or incorrect sections, as well as inconsistent naming. Here's a fixed version of the code:

**Changes made:**
1. Added an empty `SOUNDS` section since the error message indicated it was missing.
2. Ensured the capitalization was consistent for all object names, as PuzzleScript is case-sensitive. This means names should match exactly as defined in the `OBJECTS` section.
3. Added placeholder comments in the `SOUNDS` section to make it clear why it exists, even though it may not be used.

This should resolve the errors and allow for successful compilation.
