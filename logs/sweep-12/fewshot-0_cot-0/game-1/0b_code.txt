Certainly! Here is a simple implementation of a PuzzleScript game that involves pushing boxes to targets. It's a basic Sokoban-style game:

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Title and Author**: This game is called "Simple Sokoban" and you can replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

2. **Objects**: You define the visual appearance and colors of various game objects like the background, player, crate, wall, and target.

3. **Legend**: This maps the shorthand (P, C, #, .) used in the levels to the actual objects.

4. **Sounds**: An optional feature to play sounds when events occur. Here `SFX1` is triggered when crates are on targets.

5. **Collision Layers**: Defines how different objects interact with each other.

6. **Rules**: Specifies game logic, such as how the player can push crates.

7. **Win Conditions**: The condition under which the game is considered won.

8. **Levels**: Defines the level layout using the characters from the Legend.

You can easily expand this game by adding more levels, modifying the win conditions or rules, or even introducing new mechanics!
