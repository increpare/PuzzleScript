The errors you encountered are due to incorrect syntax in the [Objects] and [Legend] sections. Specifically, the formatting for defining colors and visual representations is incorrect. To fix these issues, the color definitions must be removed or adjusted to adhere to the syntax, and the Legend definitions adjusted for shorthand. Here is the corrected version of your code:

Please note the following adjustments:

1. Removed color definitions from the `[Objects]` section since PuzzleScript does not consider them.
2. Expanded the `[Legend]` to map `@` for `Player_on_Target` to ensure it can be represented in the level design.
3. Updated Level 1 to replace `$` with `o` and `@` to reflect player's start position correctly. Adjust if needed according to your intended level design. 

Make sure the levels use the correct symbols for the objects as per your latest `[Legend]` configuration.
