The errors you're encountering are due to the incorrect placement and formatting of sections in the PuzzleScript code. The Prelude section in PuzzleScript should contain specific allowed fields like title, author, homepage, etc. Moreover, blocks like `Legend`, `Sounds`, and `CollisionLayers`, need to be placed correctly after object definitions. Let's clean up your code to fix these issues:

Key changes:
1. Moved the `[Objects]` section above `[Legend]` and `[CollisionLayers]` as the game objects need to be defined first before being referenced in other sections.
2. Ensured each part is structured correctly according to PuzzleScript syntax conventions.
3. Kept the `[Sounds]` section but it's optional and simply outlined here for any future use that supports sound.
4. Corrected the `WinCondition` to match against the correct object name `Crate_on_Target`.
