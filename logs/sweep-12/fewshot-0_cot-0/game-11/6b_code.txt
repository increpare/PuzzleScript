The errors you're encountering are due to the incorrect structure of the PuzzleScript code. In particular, there are sections with incorrect headers or missing elements. I'll provide the corrected version of your game code below:

### Key Corrections:
- Corrected the `Target` object to have a line of periods (`.......`) since this aligns with a common description pattern (though visually excessive in PuzzleScript context).
- Adjusted the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to better reflect relationships between objects.
- Ensured accurate mapping in the `LEGEND` section.
