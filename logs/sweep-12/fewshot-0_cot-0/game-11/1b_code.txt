Things to note about the corrected version:
- The [Sounds] section has been left as a comment since sound effects are specific to the PuzzleScript system's capabilities and not typically included or referenced this way.
- Collision layers were adjusted properly with each entity, ensuring that player, wall, target, and crate are correctly layered.
- Ensure rule definitions are correct in terms of statements and consequences according to PuzzleScript language syntax.
- Removed extraneous characters like "$" in the level design that were not defined with a corresponding game object. Crates should be represented by 'O', targets by '.', etc.
