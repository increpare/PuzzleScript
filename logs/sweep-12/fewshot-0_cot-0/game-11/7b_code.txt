The errors in the original code are due to formatting issues where sections are not recognized properly by the PuzzleScript language. The main mistake is improper section formatting and incorrect character usage in the levels section. To fix these issues, the corrected code needs to follow the correct format for defining sections and the legend properly. Here is the corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
1. Fixed the formatting of section headers by using `========` before and after the section names.
2. Replaced `#` in the legend with the appropriate wall symbol to match the representation in the objects section.
3. Fixed characters in the level to only include defined symbols. The `$` symbol was replaced with `o`, and the `=` symbol was used instead of `.` for targets.
