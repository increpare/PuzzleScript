The errors indicate that the compiler is expecting color definitions for the objects, but they are not provided in the initial code. In PuzzleScript, each object definition is typically accompanied by a color for visualization purposes. Let's address the errors by adding sensible colors for each object. Here's the corrected version of the code:

I've added default colors for each object to provide visual differentiation during the game. Adjust the colors as you see fit for your game design.
