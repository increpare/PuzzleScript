The error messages indicate that there are lines causing issues in the prelude section of the code, which includes `[Title]`, `[Author]`, and `[Homepage]`. In PuzzleScript, these sections are not standard parts of the syntax and are not recognized. Letâ€™s remove them and correct the `Player_on_Target` and `Crate_on_Target` representation errors. Also, ensure that characters like `$` in levels, which are not defined in the legend, are replaced by defined legend elements. Here's the corrected version of your code:

### Key Changes:
- Removed `[Title]`, `[Author]`, `[Homepage]` sections, as they are not part of PuzzleScript's recognized syntax.
- Corrected the use of `Crate_on_Target` and `Player_on_Target` in the `[Legend]` and level representation to ensure they are properly defined and utilized.
- Updated the level character usage to ensure they align with the defined `[Legend]` elements. Adjustments for crate and player on targets should use `o on .` and `p on .`, which properly define `Crate_on_Target` and `Player_on_Target`.
