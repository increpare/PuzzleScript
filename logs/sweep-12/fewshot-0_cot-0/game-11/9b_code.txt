The errors in the console output are due to incorrect syntax in specifying colors for each object. The correct syntax requires the color to follow the object's character. Here's a repaired version of the game code:

In this version, each object is defined with its corresponding character and color on separate lines. Also, make sure you use the correct character in `LEGEND` and the rest of the game logic. I changed the characters for `Target` and the level to match the definitions in the `LEGEND`. I hope this resolves the errors for your game!
