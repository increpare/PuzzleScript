### Fixes Made:
1. **Line Errors**:
   - Error messages indicated problems with object, legend, sound, and rules section: 
   
2. **Object Section**: 
   - Ensure that all sprites are 5x5 as PuzzleScript requires exact sizes. There were no apparent problems here in this case.
    
3. **Legend Section**: 
   - There was a potential mistake in the legend format. Check that the legend declarations have the correct syntax. This was fine here.

4. **Rules Section**: 
   - Fixed the rules to ensure that sound triggers (`SOUND`) and state changes follow the expected format.
   - Replaced `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | ]` with `[Player | Treasure] -> [Player | Background]` for clarity and correctness.
   - Ensured rules like `[Player | Lava] -> [ ] SOUND lava DIE` correctly empty the cell.

5. **Comments and Spacing**:
   - Removed the unexpected line (such as unexpected symbols `/`) and ensured proper syntax for comments so that no errors arise from parsing issues.

With these fixes, the game should now compile and run as expected without errors.
