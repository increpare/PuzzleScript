line 43 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 51 : In the legend, define new items using the equals symbol - declarations must look like "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]".
line 51 : Incorrect format of legend - should be one of "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]", but it looks like you have a dangling "ERROR"?

line 54 : Was expecting a soundverb here (MOVE, DESTROY, CANTMOVE, or the like), but found something else.
