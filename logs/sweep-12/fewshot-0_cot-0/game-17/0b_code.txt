This game has two simple levels where the player ('P') must reach the treasure ('T') while avoiding the lava ('L'). The player uses the arrow keys to move, and the main objective is to collect all treasures in a level to win. The wall ('#') blocks the player's path and must be navigated around. If the player steps on lava, they lose that level.
