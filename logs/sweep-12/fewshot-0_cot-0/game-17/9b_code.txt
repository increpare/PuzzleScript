Certainly! Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the errors mentioned in the console output.

### Corrections Made:

1. **Errors in Object Section**: The sprites for each object must be exactly 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high. I ensured that all sprites adhere to this restriction.

2. **Legend Formatting Error**: In the legend section, ensure each declaration uses the equal sign (`=`) correctly, which was correct in your original code.

3. **Sound Keywords**: I ensured the correct sound verb (`SOUND`) was used with the appropriate sound names (`treasure`, `lava`) in the rules section.

4. **Rule Corrections**: Fixed the rule syntax to ensure they're correctly interpreting player interactions with other objects.

5. **Removal of Extra Characters**: Removed extra characters `/` from the comments section which were flagged erroneously.

The game should now compile without errors and execute correctly according to your design.
