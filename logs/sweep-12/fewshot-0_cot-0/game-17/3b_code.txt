The errors in your PuzzleScript code can be addressed as follows:

1. The `Wall` sprite is being assigned a single color black instead of grey. Correct this by using a 5x5 grid representation.
2. Ensure the sprite grid sizes are correct in defining each object's pixel art.
3. Adjust the sound section to match standard syntax or intended context.
4. Reformulate the LEGEND to align with the intended representations.

Here's the corrected version of the `Treasure Quest` game code:

Here the Wall sprite is correctly mapped to grey, and other sprites are ensured to use a proper color palette style. The SOUND section assumes that `collect` and `explode` are valid sounds within the context of this script, so make sure they are in the sound library of your PuzzleScript environment. If additional debugging is required related to sounds, consult the specific PuzzleScript documentation for further correction.
