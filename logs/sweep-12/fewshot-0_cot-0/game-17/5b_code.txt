The errors in your PuzzleScript code stem from some syntax issues. I'll address these and provide a corrected version of your game code.

### Changes made:
1. **SOUNDS Section**: The sound events were incorrect ('collect' and 'explode' are not default sound effects). They have been replaced with `SFX1` and `SFX2`, which are default system sound effects.

2. **Syntax Errors**: The original document contained several errors related to structure, particularly around incorrect syntax for sound statements. By following the PuzzleScript syntax closely, these errors have been corrected.

Make sure to test the code, as the sound effects (SFX1, SFX2) and these exact behaviors might differ slightly from your expectations since PuzzleScript has a fixed set of sound effects. Adjust accordingly if you're integrating custom sounds.
