The errors you're encountering in your PuzzleScript game code relate to the incorrect format of the `sounds` section. PuzzleScript expects specific sound events like `SFX3`, `ENDLEVEL`, and soundverbs like `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`, etc. Your code is trying to use custom sound commands, which are not supported. Let's fix the `sounds` section with appropriate sound events.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

In this updated version, I've added sounds for `MOVE` (using `SFX3`) and `ENDLEVEL`(using `SFX1`), which are the standard sound events supported by PuzzleScript. Adjust these according to the actual sound effects you want for your game as needed.
