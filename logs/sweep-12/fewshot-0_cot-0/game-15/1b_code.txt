Certainly! The errors you've encountered in your PuzzleScript code concern incorrect sound syntax and misconfigured rules. Let's fix these issues.

1. **Sound Syntax Error**: The correct syntax for sounds involves associating them with events like `move`, `win`, etc., directly followed by a sound name without square brackets, and you specify the sound for these events inside curly braces.

2. **Rule Syntax Error**: In PuzzleScript, each pattern on the left-hand side of a rule must be matched entirely on the right-hand side, meaning if you have two cells on the left, you must also have two cells on the right.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```

With these adjustments:

- I've fixed the sound syntax by wrapping the sound specifications inside curly braces.
- I've matched the patterns on both sides of the rules to ensure they have the same length.

This code should now compile and run correctly, depending on the rest of the framework synthesized in the PuzzleScript interpreter.
