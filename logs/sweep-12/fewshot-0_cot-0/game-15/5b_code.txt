The issue in the provided code is with the sound seed values in the `sounds` section. These should each be unique non-zero integers representing the sound to be played. Let's assume these should be set to example seeds like `123456` and `654321` for demonstration purposes. Here is the corrected code:

This revision replaces the non-unique placeholders with suggested example sound seeds. You should replace `123456` and `654321` with actual unique values generated through the PuzzleScript generator or select other valid numbers as needed for your game.
