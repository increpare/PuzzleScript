Certainly! The error suggests that the sound seeds provided in the game code are not valid. Let's correct them with proper sound seed values.

Here's the updated code:

```

In this version, I've replaced the sound seeds with valid numbers (`123123` and `321321`) which should resolve the errors in the console output.
