The issue in the provided code is with the sound seed values in the `sounds` section. These should be numerical values indicating sound seeds but are found to be invalid string inputs. Here's the corrected version of the code:

To fix the issue, I changed the sound seeds under the `sounds` section to valid numeric values `123123` and `321321`. Make sure these values are unique and do not conflict with any other seeds generated.
