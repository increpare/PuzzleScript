Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code. The issue was with the sound seeds in the `sounds` section. Letâ€™s use valid sound seeds for those entries:

```

In this corrected version, I've replaced the invalid sound seed "321321" in the `ENDLEVEL` sound with a different seed "654321" which is a valid example seed. You can replace it with any other valid seed generated from your PuzzleScript environment.
