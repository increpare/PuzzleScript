Certainly! The errors in your PuzzleScript code indicate that the ordering of the sections is incorrect, and you've referenced some object names incorrectly using lowercase letters instead of uppercase. Below is a corrected version of your game code:

Changes Made:
1. Added the `SOUNDS` section, even if it is empty, to maintain the correct order of sections.
2. Adjusted the case of object names in the `RULES` section to match those defined in the `OBJECTS` and `LEGEND` sections. The code now correctly references `Player`, `Treasure`, and `Goal` with an uppercase initial letter. 

With these changes, your code should compile without errors.
