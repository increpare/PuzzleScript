The console errors you're seeing are due to incorrect sprite definitions. Specifically, the matrices for each sprite should only contain numbers that correspond to colors defined in their palette (0 indicates transparency, and numbers 1 and onwards refer to colors you define). The code you have mainly uses 0 but tries to access non-existent colors.

Below is a fixed version of your code. I've adjusted the sprite matrices for `Player`, `Wall`, and `Treasure`, making sure they align with the single color you've defined for each (the error messages suggested issues with these in past attempts). The wall should be filled with its defined color 'B' (Blue), and other errors stem from incorrect matrix configurations:

This version should compile without errors. Let me know if there are any other issues!
