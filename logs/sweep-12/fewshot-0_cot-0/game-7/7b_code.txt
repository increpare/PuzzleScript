The error messages indicate that the game is missing a definition for the "#" symbol, which is typically used to represent walls in PuzzleScript games. To fix the issue, we need to add an entry for "#" in the LEGEND section to associate it with the Wall object. Here's the corrected version of the code:

This addition should resolve the errors related to the '#' symbol not being recognized. The game should now compile properly with the wall symbol properly defined in the legend.
