### Changes Made:

1. **Rule Correction:**
    - In the rule `[ > Player | Treasure ] -> [ > Player ] [ ]`, corrected it to `[ > Player | Treasure ] -> [ > Player | ]` to ensure the same number of patterns on both sides of the arrow.

2. **Rule Correction:**
    - Corrected the rule `[ > Player | Goal no Treasure ] -> [ > Player win ]` to `[ > Player | Goal ] -> [ > Player | Goal win ]` to ensure the correct syntax and pattern matching.

These changes fix the errors by ensuring that each pattern detection/replacement section on the left of the arrow matches with a pattern section on the right.
