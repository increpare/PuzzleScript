The errors in the code are primarily related to the way sprite colors are defined and a syntax error in defining the Wall sprite. In PuzzleScript, each sprite should use a set of colors from the defined color names, and "X" usually refers to a color from the color palette while "0" is the transparent/non-filled part. Let's address these issues:

1. Define a more consistent use of color for the PLAYER and TREASURE.
2. Correct the Wall sprite representation using a defined color instead of "X".

Here's the repaired version of the code:

In this corrected code:
- I replaced certain color definitions for the Player and Treasure with numbers that match the color palette index as each object must define colors inside a 5x5 grid.
- Changed the `XXXXX` definition in the Wall sprite to `BBBBB` to match the BLUE color, as `X` should map to an actual color defined in the sprite's color palette.
- Made sure the shapes matched the expected format of using the defined colors consistently.
