Certainly! The errors mentioned are mostly about incorrect color definitions and duplicate object definitions. I've corrected the color definitions and removed duplicate lines to fix these issues. Here's the corrected version:

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected capitalized '0's in object patterns to use '.' instead, as the original patterns were incorrectly accessing the nonexistent color index.
2. Removed the duplicate and erroneous object definition lines for "Wall" to eliminate multiple definitions of `BBBBB`.

These improvements should eliminate the errors and ensure your game compiles correctly.
