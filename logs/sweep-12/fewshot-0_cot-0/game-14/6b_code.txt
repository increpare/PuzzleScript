The errors in your provided code are due to the incorrect definition of the color for the `BoxOnTarget` object. Let's correct the color definition and ensure the naming is consistent with PuzzleScript syntax. Here is the repaired version of your code:

In this corrected version, I specified `ORANGE` as the color for `BoxOnTarget`. If you intended to differentiate `BoxOnTarget` with a specific color shade like "light orange", note that you might need to adjust your colors based on available basic colors in PuzzleScript since it doesn't natively support color blends or custom colors outside of its predefined set.
