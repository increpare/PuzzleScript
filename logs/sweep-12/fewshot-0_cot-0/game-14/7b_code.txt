The errors in your code are due to the incorrect definition of the `BoxOnTarget` object. Let's correct it by defining `BoxOnTarget` properly with the correct color format. Here is the repaired version of the code:

In this corrected version, the `BoxOnTarget` object is defined with the color `ORANGE`, and no erroneous comment or incorrect color designation interrupts the object definition. This should address the compilation errors you encountered.
