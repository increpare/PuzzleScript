Certainly! The errors in your code were primarily caused by incorrect sprite dimensions, misuse of keywords, and palette color issues. Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

Key corrections made:
- All sprites were resized to be 5x5 pixels.
- Fixed the use of invalid color indices that were not defined within each object's palette.
- Removed "........" which incorrectly represented an object and substituted it with valid sprite patterns. 
- Ensured the use of proper coloring where necessary based on declared palette sizes in each object definition. 

This should resolve the errors and work as expected in the PuzzleScript engine.
