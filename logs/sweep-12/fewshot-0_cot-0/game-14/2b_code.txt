The console output indicates that there are issues with sprite definitions where color layers have been wrongly specified, leading to errors. I will modify the code to use correct sprite patterns by reducing unnecessary lines and ensuring correct object dimensions.

Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code:

Explanation of Changes:
- Corrected the sprite patterns of `Wall`, `Box`, and `BoxOnTarget` to ensure all pixels are filled and specified within the object dimensions (5x5 grid).
- Adjusted `Target` to also fit the 5x5 dimension but minimized to outline its small target area.
- The changes ensure the sprites do not try to access nonexistent layers or colors in their definitions.
