### Key Fixes:

1. **Sound Errors:** Removed the `SOUNDS` section because PuzzleScript does not have a native sound implementation in basic rules.
  
2. **Map Symbol Errors:** Fixed the map symbol ' ' and replaced it with '.' for Background. PuzzleScript typically requires you to explicitly map background tiles as well, rather than using spaces.

3. **Rule Length Errors:** Corrected the rules in the `RULES` section to ensure that patterns on the left and right sides are of equal lengths. For instance, included all layers necessary in player interactions and no implicit mismatch or layer removal.

These changes should fix the reported issues and allow your game to function properly.
