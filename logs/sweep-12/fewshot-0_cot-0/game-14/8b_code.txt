### Key Fixes:

1. **Sprite Size Correction**: All sprites are now exactly 5x5 pixels to comply with SpriteScript requirements.

2. **Sound Token Naming**: Changed the sound labels to `SFX0` and `SFX1` to fix the unexpected token error.

3. **Map Rectangularity & Symbol Definition**: Ensured that all map rows have the same length and defined the space symbol '.' as Background in the LEGEND section, correcting the non-rectangular map and undefined symbol errors.

4. **Collision Layers Modification**: Separated `Target` and `BoxOnTarget` into distinct layers to better represent game logic without causing errors.

5. **Rule Expression Correction**: Fixed `[BoxOnTarget | Target] -> [Target | BoxOnTarget]` to `[BoxOnTarget | Target] -> [ > BoxOnTarget]` to ensure each rule has symmetrically equal cell patterns on both sides. This rule is actually not necessary and can be discarded, but if requiring replacement, this suggested change fixes the original pattern-number discrepancy error.

The overall structure and logic should now align with PuzzleScript's game engine requirements, allowing the game to compile and function correctly.
