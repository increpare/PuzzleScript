Certainly! It seems like there might be a configuration issue in the levels for this PuzzleScript. Here is the revised code with adjustments to make all levels solvable:

**Changes Made:**

- **Level 1**: Reconfigured to allow movement and block placement such that the player can push both blocks onto targets.
- **Level 2**: Reconfigured so that the player and blocks are positioned in a way that allows blocks to be moved to the target.

These changes should fix the errors and ensure that all levels are solvable.
