### Changes Made:
1. Made all sprite graphics in the OBJECTS section exactly 5x5 in size.
2. Corrected the rule syntax for pushing `Player` and `Block`, ensuring that they are valid for the collision layers. Switched from `[ > P B ] -> [ > B P ]` to `[ > P | B ] -> [ > B | P ]` which uses the adjacency operator `|` instead of the direct adjacency which was causing an issue. This change respects how objects can interact based on collision layers.
