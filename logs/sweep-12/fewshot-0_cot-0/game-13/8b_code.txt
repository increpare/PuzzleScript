Let's take a closer look at the levels and ensure they are solvable within the game's mechanics. The main goals are to ensure that each Block ('B') can reach a Target ('T'), considering the Player ('P') can push them.

Here's the revised code with solvable levels:

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Level 0**: This level remains unchanged as it was already solvable.
   
2. **Level 1**: Reduced complexity by ensuring clear paths for all Blocks ('B') to Targets ('T'), with the Player ('P') able to navigate and push the Blocks.
   
3. **Level 2**: Simplified the design to ensure the Player can reach the Block and push it to the Target. A simpler configuration ensures a clear path for the Player to maneuver the Block to its destination.

With these adjustments, each level should now be solvable according to the game's pushing mechanics.
