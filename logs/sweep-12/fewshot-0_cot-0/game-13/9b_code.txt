To solve the levels that are not solvable, we need to ensure that each block can reach a target and there are no inaccessible areas. Let's fix Level 1 and Level 2.

Here are the changes made to the levels:
- For Level 1, I rearranged the blocks and targets ensuring all blocks have a clear path to reach a target.
- For Level 2, I verified the accessibility and made sure to avoid any obstructions that would prevent the player from positioning a block onto a target.
