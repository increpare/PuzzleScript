The following updated version of the code addresses the issues raised in the console output by correcting the win condition and defining walls as objects within the game.

Key changes:
1. Added the `Wall` object to define what "#" represents.
2. Incorporated the `Wall` object in the `LEGEND` section.
3. Fixed the win condition by using the correct object name `B` for `Block`.
