Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the different sections:

- **Title & Author**: Metadata for the game.
- **Objects**: Defines the graphical representation and color of each object in the game.
- **Legend**: Maps the character symbols to the objects they represent in the game environment.
- **CollisionLayers**: Specifies the layers for different objects, affecting how they interact.
- **Rules**: Dictates the behaviors and interactions between game objects. For instance, pushing a block swaps the player and the block.
- **WinConditions**: Defines the conditions required to win the game. Here, all targets must have blocks on them.
- **Levels**: Describes the grid layout of each game level using symbols defined in the legend.

This game involves pushing blocks to cover targets, a classic puzzle mechanic that requires strategic movement planning.
