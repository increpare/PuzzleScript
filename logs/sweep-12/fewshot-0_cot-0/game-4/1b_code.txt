**Corrections Made:**

1. For each sprite, the number of characters per row should be the same across all rows. In this case, the `Player` and `Goal` matrices were correctly defined, so the error was not in the actual sprite definitions. Instead, the alignment of the comments should be checked if there are more issues with reading the matrix display.
   
2. Removed the invalid `All Goal on Player` win condition. The correct syntax is `All Player on Goal`.

3. Corrected the issue in the rule by rearranging the condition correctly to reflect a push mechanic with `[ > Player | Goal ] -> [ Player on Goal ]`. The `>` operator indicates that the Player is attempting to move onto Goal.

The corrected game should now compile without errors and function as expected.
