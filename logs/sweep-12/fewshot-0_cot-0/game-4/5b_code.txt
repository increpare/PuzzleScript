To fix the issues outlined in the compilation errors, we need to ensure that sections are properly closed with equal signs on independent lines, avoid non-rectangular maps, and correctly define the keys in the levels according to the legend. Here's the corrected version of the code:

Changes made:
1. Ensured section headers (like "LEVELS") are properly defined with lines of equals signs above and below.
2. Corrected the "LEVELS" section to maintain the rectangular shape for each level map.
3. Fixed placement of "=====" lines for levels to ensure proper separation.
