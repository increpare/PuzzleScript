The issues in your PuzzleScript game code seem to originate from a few formatting errors and omissions in defining the legend and collision layers. Here's a revised version of your code that resolves these issues:

```

Here's what has been fixed:

1. Ensured consistent use of `=` signs to denote sections. The console output error at line 32 was likely due to incorrect section separation. Each section should be properly marked by a consistent number of `=` signs, and typically nothing else should follow on the same line.

2. Added commas between `Player` and `Goal` in the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. This enables them to share the same layer, allowing the player to interact with the goal.

3. Ensured that each row in the levels is of equal length by being mindful of trailing whitespace issues.

4. Added additional `==========` separators for the levels to maintain clarity.

These fixes should prevent errors during compilation and improve the functionality of your game.
