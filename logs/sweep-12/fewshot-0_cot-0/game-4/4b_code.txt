Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. The errors were related to incorrect section headings and level formatting. I've fixed these issues for you:

Level 1

Level 2

```

Changes made:
1. Removed the comment after `==========` in the sections, as PuzzleScript expects no comments or extra text on these separator lines.
2. Corrected the level formatting by removing the `;` before each level name, which isn't needed in PuzzleScript format. 

This should resolve the syntax issues you encountered.
