The game code has a few errors related to how the `messages` are structured and possibly some other minor formatting issues. Let's repair the issues:

```plaintext

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Messages section (line 87-89 issue)**: There was an unnecessary space or newline handling issue. The message is correctly structured now as a single line in the `messages` section.
2. **Ensure consistency**: All sections are properly formatted without stray or misplaced entries.

Now, this code should compile successfully without generating the aforementioned errors. If issues persist, ensure that all sections begin and end with the `===========` delimiters and have correct naming in terms of entities and rules.
