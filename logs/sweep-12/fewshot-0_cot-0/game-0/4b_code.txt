The errors you are encountering are related to the incorrect definition of colors for your objects. The PuzzleScript language expects colors to be defined after the object keyword, and each pixel color should be specified next. Here's the repaired version of the code that should resolve the errors:

```

Key adjustments made:
- Corrected color definitions in the `objects` section for each object by using the proper format with a `#` followed by the color hex code.
- The pixel art for the `Star` object was also updated, using `0` for its color, matching the provided color palette.

This should resolve the compilation errors related to color definitions.
