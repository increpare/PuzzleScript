It seems there are a few issues with the code, particularly related to the way the messages section is formatted and defined. Let's fix these issues:

1. The warning about line 85 suggests that a space should be added after the `message` keyword (if it were used), although your current messages block is not being used correctly. The messages section is likely not needed as messages should directly follow the `winconditions` (as feedback shown on screen).

2. There's a parsing issue with the `messages`, and it's not using the proper syntax. We'll format and place comments instead of trying to use a separate `messages` block.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Note: The intended 'congratulations' message can appear to users by including it in the level definition, but PuzzleScript does not currently support a dedicated `messages` section for endgame messages. Instead, use a comment or consider incorporating external elements to signal a win, potentially through level design or in-game feedback.
