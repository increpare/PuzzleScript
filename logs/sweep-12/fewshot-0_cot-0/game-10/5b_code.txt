The errors in the console output indicate that the "LEGEND" section is out of order and that object definitions are missing before it. We need to define objects in the "OBJECTS" section before using them in the "LEGEND" section. Here is the corrected code:

```plaintext

Player

```

This version of the code correctly places the "OBJECTS" section before the "LEGEND" section, and it defines all objects used in the game.
