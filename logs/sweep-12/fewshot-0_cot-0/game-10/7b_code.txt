Here's a repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. The issues were mainly related to the incorrect position of color assignments and missing object layer specifications. I've fixed those based on your description, and removed the placeholder sound section that was causing errors:

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Color Specification**: Corrected the color assignments for objects by removing the word "color" (since only color name is needed) after the object name.
2. **Removed Sounds Section:** The placeholder sounds section was causing errors and has been removed.
3. **Adjusted Collision Layer Ordering:** Updated collision layers to ensure 'Background, Goal' are on the same layer since both should function together without blocking.

Test this version to see if it compiles and runs as expected.
