Here is a corrected version of the code. I have adjusted the order of the sections according to the PuzzleScript format, ensuring all required sections are present and correctly ordered. The comments causing issues have been removed or placed appropriately.

These changes ensure the sections are in the correct order and empty sections are maintained for proper compilation and execution of the game.
