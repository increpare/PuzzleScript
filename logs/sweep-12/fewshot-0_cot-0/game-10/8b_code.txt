### Changes Made:
1. **Order of Sections**: The `collisionlayers` section should come after the `legend` but before `sounds`. Even if you don't have any sounds, the `sounds` section must still be explicitly included.
2. **Collision Layers**: Separated `Background` from `Goal` into different layers as `Background must be in a layer by itself`.
3. **Fixed Typographical Issues**:
   - There was an incorrect rule comment in the `rules` section that was not recognized as a comment. A leading `#` was missing. Added the correct comment marker (`#`) to indicate commentary.
4. **Added Sounds Section**: This section was missing as indicated by the error, even though no sounds are defined, it's necessary to include it.
