The errors in your PuzzleScript game code are primarily due to incorrect formatting and missing sections. Here's the corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```plaintext

```

Here are the changes I made:

1. Added the correct indentation for the `color` specifications in the `objects` section.
2. Added a `rules` section, even though it's currently empty, since PuzzleScript requires it to be present before `winconditions`.
3. Fixed the capitalization of object names in `collisionlayers` to match the naming used in the `objects` section. All words in `collisionlayers` should start with a capital letter to refer to the defined objects. 

This corrected version should now compile without errors. You can add specific game rules in the `rules` section based on your game design needs.
