Certainly! The errors in your PuzzleScript code are due to a few mistakes regarding the order of sections and missing definitions. Here’s the corrected version:

### Key Corrections:
1. The `legend` section should come before the `collisionlayers` section because it defines objects that are used in the collision layers.
2. Ensure all defined objects in `legend` are also in `objects`. The `Background` was correctly defined later, so it's not part of the `collisionlayers` definition—it serves as the backdrop and doesn’t need collision logic.
3. Adjust the order of sections as per PuzzleScript's requirements: the `legend` section must precede the `collisionlayers` section.
