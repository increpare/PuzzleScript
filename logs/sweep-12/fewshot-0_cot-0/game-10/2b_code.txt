Certainly! It looks like there are some issues with the input you provided regarding the structure and ordering of the sections. Let's fix those errors in the code for the PuzzleScript game:

Key Adjustments:
- Removed the incorrect `run_rules` section and its contents as it was incorrectly placed and without a proper context.
- Ensured sections are properly separated by `========`.
- Made sure all defined sections have correct syntax and are properly structured.

This should fix the errors and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
