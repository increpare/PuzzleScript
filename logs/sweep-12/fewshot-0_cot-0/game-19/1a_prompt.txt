=================================
line 7 : Unrecognised stuff in the prelude.
line 17 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 21 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER.
line 22 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER.
line 23 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER.
line 24 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object PLAYER.
line 28 : Unknown junk in spritematrix for object CRATE.
