This is a simple implementation of a Sokoban-like game using PuzzleScript syntax. The objective is to push all crates (`C`) onto the targets (`$`). The game includes basic rules for moving crates and conditions to win when all crates are on targets. The two levels included provide progressively challenging puzzles to solve.
