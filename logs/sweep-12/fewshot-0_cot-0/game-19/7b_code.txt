The errors in your PuzzleScript game code appear to be due to incorrect formatting in the object sprite sections. The sprites in PuzzleScript must be exactly 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high, with period (`.`) characters representing transparency or empty space. The error messages are indicating junk input in lines where the sprite matrices should be.

Here's the corrected code:

I reviewed each sprite section to ensure they meet the 5x5 requirement. Make sure to carefully replace or adjust any custom sprites to maintain this size constraint. Please give this version a try and see if it resolves the errors you've encountered.
