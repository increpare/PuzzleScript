The error messages suggest issues with the object definitions, specifically that the sprite matrix does not match the required 5x5 size or contains characters that are not allowed. Let's correct those problems by ensuring all object definitions have a 5x5 sprite and proper naming conventions. Here's the fixed version of your PuzzleScript game code:

You may notice that the original sprite definitions for "Crate" and "CrateOnTarget" had a deviation from the typical single character centered representation, which I corrected by centering a 2x2 block to fit standard styling conventions. If the representation was a unique stylistic choice, the code reflects a more typical pattern that should work correctly with PuzzleScript's requirements.
