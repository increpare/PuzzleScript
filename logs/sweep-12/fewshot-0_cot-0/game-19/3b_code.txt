The errors you encountered arise from improper formatting and case sensitivity in the PuzzleScript language. Here's the corrected version of the code addressing the issues:

### Key Fixes:
1. **Sprite Definitions**: Each sprite must be exactly 5x5 in size. Fixed the improper definition that could cause confusion.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: In PuzzleScript, the object names in the rules and legend section must match exactly (including case) with those defined in the objects section. Ensure they all start with a capital letter to be consistent with their declarations. 
3. **Sound Issue**: Removed the "SokobanMove PUSH" line because it's not defined properly in your context. Add sounds using the correct format and ensure they are triggered via the correct syntax.
4. **Extraneous Pixels**: Ensured each sprite definition contained exactly 5 rows of 5 characters, representing the visual for each object.

Review the changes and test the game again to ensure functionality.
