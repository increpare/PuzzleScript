Here's a repaired version of the code. The main issues were with the incorrect syntax for color definitions in objects, the addition of unnecessary characters in object names, and improper sprite dimensions. Each object sprite must be exactly 5x5 in size, and colors should be defined properly.

I updated the objects' sprite definitions to ensure each is exactly 5x5 and corrected the color definitions. Additionally, I fixed other minor syntax issues in the level design for continuity and logical errors. Now the game should compile correctly.
