Here's a repaired version of the PuzzleScript code that addresses the errors from the console output:

Changes made:
1. Added a `Wall` object to define the "#" symbol, which was missing from the legend and object definitions.
2. Added the `Wall` to the `COLLISIONLAYERS` to indicate it as part of the game world.
3. Removed the `SOUNDS` section since PuzzleScript does not have built-in sound function syntax in standard libraryâ€”those tokens were not recognized, leading to compilation errors.
