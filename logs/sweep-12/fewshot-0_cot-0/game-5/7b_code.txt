The unsolvable level is likely due to the arrangement of walls and objects that makes it impossible for the player to accomplish the win conditions. Let's adjust the level 2 design to ensure it is solvable. Ensuring that the player can push blocks onto targets, here's the revised game code with a fix for level 2:

In level 2, I've adjusted the level to be more consistent, ensuring that players have a clear path to push the blocks onto the targets. It now follows a similar pattern to the previous levels, making it solvable.
