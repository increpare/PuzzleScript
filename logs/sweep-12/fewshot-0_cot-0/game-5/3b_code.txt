The errors you encountered are due to incorrect color definitions in the `OBJECTS` section of your PuzzleScript code. Each object needs a correct color palette definition to display properly. Here's how you can fix those issues by ensuring each object has an appropriate color defined for each pixel:

In this corrected code, I've replaced the erroneous color index `1` in the object artwork with `0`, which is the correct index for single-color objects like those in your game. Each object uses `0` to reference its defined color on a per-pixel basis.
