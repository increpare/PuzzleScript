Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the issues noted in the error messages by ensuring all objects and sections are correctly defined and ordered according to PuzzleScript's syntax requirements.

Key corrections made:

1. **Defined the SOUNDS section:** Although no sounds are specified, the section must be present for correct section order handling.
2. **Object names case consistency:** Ensured that all object names in `RULES` correspond to the names as defined (case-sensitive), like `Player`, `Block`, `Target`, etc.
3. **Checked rule syntax:** Ensured the syntax and object references are correct.
