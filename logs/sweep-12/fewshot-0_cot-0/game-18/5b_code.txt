The errors you encountered are due to some incorrect usage and missing elements in the code. PuzzleScript has a specific way to define game elements and it looks like there were some misunderstandings. Here is the corrected version of your game code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Gem Collector

[Author]
PuzzleScript Developer

[Objects]
Background
transparent

Player
P
yellow

Gem
G
green

EnemyBot
E
red

Wall
#
gray

[Sounds]
gemCollectP
pickup2

enemyCatchP
die

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Wall
Gem
EnemyBot
Player

[Rules]
[ > Player | Gem ] -> [ > Player ] (message "Gem collected!") (sound gemCollectP)
[ Player | EnemyBot ] -> RESTART (message "Caught by an enemy!") (sound enemyCatchP)

# Enemy Automatic Movement
[> EnemyBot | no Player ] -> [ no Player | > EnemyBot ]

[WinConditions]
All Gem

[Levels]

// Level 0
#####
#...#
#.P.#
#...#
#####

// Level 1
######
#P..G#
#..E.#
#...##
######

[Text]
title Win
text You collected all the gems!
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Objects Section**: Each object needs a name and a character mapping along with a color specification.
2. **Sounds Section**: Each sound must be properly defined with the sound ID.
3. Modified `RESTART` command to be in uppercase to match the correct command case.
4. Removed unnecessary elements like `Background` in the `[Objects]` section beyond its initial mention.

These changes should resolve the errors you previously encountered and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
