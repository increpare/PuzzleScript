The errors you're encountering are due to the syntax used in the `[Objects]` and `[CollisionLayers]` sections. PuzzleScript uses a specific format for these sections. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```plaintext
// Title: Gem Collector
// Author: PuzzleScript Developer

===========
OBJECTS
===========

Background
transparent

Player
yellow
P

Gem
green
G

EnemyBot
red
E

Wall
gray
#

===========
LEGEND
===========

. = Background
P = Player
G = Gem
E = EnemyBot
# = Wall

==============
COLLISIONLAYERS
==============

Background
Wall
Gem
EnemyBot
Player

===========
RULES
===========

[ > Player | Gem ] -> [ > Player ] (message "Gem collected!") // Sound is not implemented in standard PuzzleScript
[ Player | EnemyBot ] -> RESTART (message "Caught by an enemy!") // Sound is not implemented in standard PuzzleScript

# Enemy Automatic Movement
[> EnemyBot | no Player ] -> [ no Player | > EnemyBot ]

==============
WINCONDITIONS
==============

All Gem

===========
LEVELS
===========

// Level 0
#####
#...#
#.P.#
#...#
#####

// Level 1
######
#P..G#
#..E.#
#...##

===========
TEXT
===========

title Win
text You collected all the gems!
```

Here are the corrections made:
1. Corrected the `OBJECTS` section to properly define objects.
2. Added a `LEGEND` section to provide mapping of character symbols to game objects.
3. Maintained the same structure for other sections, as they appeared to be formatted correctly.
