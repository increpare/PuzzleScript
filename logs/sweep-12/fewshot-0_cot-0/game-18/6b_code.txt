The errors in the code are due to the syntax used in the [Title], [Author], and [Sounds] blocks, which don't follow the correct PuzzleScript syntax. These sections are not part of the typical PuzzleScript prelude. Instead, we should define our game title and author using comments, and handle sounds elsewhere. Here's a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code:

```plaintext
// Title: Gem Collector
// Author: PuzzleScript Developer

[Objects]

transparent

Player
P
yellow

Gem
G
green

EnemyBot
E

Modifications and corrections made:
- Removed the [Title], [Author], and [Sounds] sections as they are not part of the standard PuzzleScript syntax.
- Added comments at the top to indicate the game title and author.
- Commented out sound implementations as PuzzleScript does not natively support custom sound configuration outside the editor. If sound effects are supported, they need configuring as per the hosting environment or specific build tool.
