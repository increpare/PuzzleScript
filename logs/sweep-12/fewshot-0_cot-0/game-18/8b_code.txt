Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code that addresses the compilation errors:

### Changes Made:
1. **Sprite Size and Characters**: Ensured all objects are defined with 5x5 pixel sprites using legal characters and symbols.
2. **Legend Entries**: Updated the legend to properly use single unique characters `P`, `G`, `E`, `#`.
3. **Collision Layers Section Order**: Moved the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section after adding an empty `SOUNDS` section to maintain the correct order.
4. **Rule Entity Names**: The `RULES` used correctly defined identifiers in the code. There were no issues here.
5. **Retained Enemies Movement**: Fixed the error regarding enemy movement while correcting the missing `no` element in rules.

This should correct all the compilation errors and allow the game to run as intended.
