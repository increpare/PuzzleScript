The errors in your PuzzleScript code arise from unrecognized sections in the prelude. PuzzleScript recognizes specific sections such as `[Title]`, `[Author]`, `[Legend]`, `[Sounds]`, `[CollisionLayers]`, `[Rules]`, `[WinConditions]`, `[Levels]`, and `[Text]`. The sections `[Homepage]` and `[Background]` you included are not valid PuzzleScript prelude sections. Let's remove these invalid sections and make necessary adjustments. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Gem Collector

[Author]
PuzzleScript Developer

[Legend]
. = Background
P = Player
G = Gem
E = EnemyBot
# = Wall

[Sounds]
crateMoveP = push1
gemCollectP = pickup2
enemyCatchP = die

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Player, Gem, EnemyBot, Wall

[Rules]
Player > Gem → Player (message "Gem collected!") gemCollectP
Player > EnemyBot → restart (message "Caught by an enemy!") enemyCatchP

// Enemy Automatic Movement
EnemyBot no Player → no Player | EnemyBot north
EnemyBot no Player → no Player | EnemyBot south

[WinConditions]
All Gem

[Levels]

// Level 0
#####
#...#
#.P.#
#...#
#####

// Level 1
######
#P..G#
#..E.#
#...##
######

# Add more levels as needed

[Text]
title Win
text You collected all the gems!
```

This code should now compile without errors. If you want to add more custom information or context about your game, you can include it in the `[Text]` section at the end or find other creative ways to incorporate it into the game.
