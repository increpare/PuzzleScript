Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Gem Collector

[Author]
PuzzleScript Developer

[Legend]
P = Player
G = Gem
E = EnemyBot
# = Wall

[Sounds]
gemCollectP = pickup2
enemyCatchP = die

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Player
Gem
EnemyBot
Wall

[Rules]
[ > Player | Gem ] -> [ > Player ] (message "Gem collected!") (sound gemCollectP)
[ Player | EnemyBot ] -> restart (message "Caught by an enemy!") (sound enemyCatchP)

// Enemy Automatic Movement
[> EnemyBot | no Player ] -> [ no Player | > EnemyBot ]

[WinConditions]
All Gem

[Levels]

// Level 0
#####
#...#
#.P.#
#...#
#####

// Level 1
######
#P..G#
#..E.#
#...##
######

[Text]
title Win
text You collected all the gems!
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Removed `.` symbol for `Background` in the `[Legend]` section, hence no direct usage of `Background` in `CollisionLayers`.
2. `CollisionLayers` should separate entities by specifying each on a new line, and correctly list what appears in the game (i.e., `Background`, `Player`, `Gem`, `EnemyBot`, `Wall`).
3. Corrected the syntax in `[Rules]` by using the correct pattern `[ > Actor | Condition ] -> [ Change ]` and adding sound actions and messages correctly.
4. Enhanced rule logic to use the correct pattern for detecting conditions and triggering sound effects.

These changes should address the errors and make the game compile successfully.
