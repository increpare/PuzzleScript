The errors you encountered are due to the use of incorrect formats in the sprite matrix for each object. The PuzzleScript language expects the sprites to be a specific size, typically 5x5, composed of the character "@" and space to represent color, unless you are using fixed-width colored blocks. However, seems there are unnecessary "#" or codes which are occuping more than 5 lines. Let's fix these issues:

### Key Changes:
- Each object's sprite matrix is defined as a 5x5 grid.
- Player, Gem, and EnemyBot objects now use `@` for their visual representation.
- Wall remains a 5x5 using `#` for solid visual representation.

This revised code should compile and run correctly in PuzzleScript, assuming all other game logic and conditions are properly defined.
