The errors in your PuzzleScript game code appear to be related to syntax issues in the prelude sections such as `[Objects]`, `[Sounds]`, and so on. Let's correct it:

```plaintext
[Title]
Gem Collector

[Author]
PuzzleScript Developer

[Objects]
Background
P = Player
G = Gem
E = EnemyBot
# = Wall

[Sounds]
gemCollectP = pickup2
enemyCatchP = die

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Wall
Gem
EnemyBot
Player

[Rules]
[ > Player | Gem ] -> [ > Player ] (message "Gem collected!") (sound gemCollectP)
[ Player | EnemyBot ] -> restart (message "Caught by an enemy!") (sound enemyCatchP)

// Enemy Automatic Movement
[> EnemyBot | no Player ] -> [ no Player | > EnemyBot ]

[WinConditions]
All Gem

[Levels]

// Level 0
#####
#...#
#.P.#
#...#
#####

// Level 1
######
#P..G#
#..E.#
#...##
######

[Text]
title Win
text You collected all the gems!
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Objects Section**: Ensure `Background` is defined as the first object type since it is referred to in collision layers and rules implicitly. If background handling is not explicit, future logic errors can occur.
2. **Syntax Consistency**: Check for typos and confirm sections are properly defined, as sometimes similar errors arise from missing section headings.
   
This version should correct the syntax issues mentioned and allow your game to compile successfully. Be sure to test the behavior of the game and ensure all logic operates as expected.
