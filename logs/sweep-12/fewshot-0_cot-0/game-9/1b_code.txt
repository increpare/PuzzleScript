Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. The errors you encountered were due to incorrect color indexing in your object definitions. Each color in a sprite is supposed to be indexed starting from 0, and there should be a corresponding color defined for each index. I've fixed the color indices for the "Player" and "Wall" objects, and provided clear color definitions for each sprite.

This corrected code should fix the errors you encountered regarding incorrect color usage in the sprites. Each sprite is now using consistent and valid patterns that correspond to the defined colors.
