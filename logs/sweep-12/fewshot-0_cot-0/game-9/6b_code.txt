### Changes Made:
1. **SOUNDS Section**: Corrected the sound trigger by removing the word "Treasure". The correct syntax for sound associations should be `Player Move direction sound`.
   
2. **LEVELS Section**: Removed level headers (`/0`, `/1`, `/2`), as PuzzleScript does not require explicit level identifiers. By default, all level definitions are read sequentially, and the header markers were mistyped.

3. **Rectangular Maps**: Checked that all rows in each level have the same length, as required by PuzzleScript. The earlier maps already seemed rectangular, but any non-compliance error is typically due to trailing spaces or inconsistent row lengths in level definitions, which should be closely monitored.

With these changes, the game should compile without errors.
