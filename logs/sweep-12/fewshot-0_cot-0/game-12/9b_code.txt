The errors you're encountering are because the colors specified for each object are using lowercase letters, which are not recognized as valid color names in PuzzleScript. Here’s the corrected version of the game code with proper capitalization and valid color names:

This code should compile without errors. Make sure to use capital letters for specifying colors in PuzzleScript, as it expects color names in a specific format.
