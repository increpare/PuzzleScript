The errors you're encountering are because the colors specified for each object are using lowercase letters, which are not recognized as valid color names in PuzzleScript. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the game code with proper capitalization and valid color names:

This code should compile without errors. Make sure to use capitalized color names as PuzzleScript expects standard named colors that are case-sensitive.
