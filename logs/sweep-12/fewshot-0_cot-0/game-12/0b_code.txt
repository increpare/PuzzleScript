This game consists of a player ('P') who can move crates ('C') onto goals ('.'). The player can also occupy goal spaces, turning into 'PlayerOnGoal' ('B'). Each crate should be moved onto a goal to transform into 'CrateOnGoal' ('O'). The win condition is fulfilled when all crates are on goals. 

Remember, players can only push crates, not pull them, and cannot move through walls ('#'). 

You can further expand this by adding more complex levels or additional rules and objects to deepen the mechanics. Enjoy creating your puzzles!
