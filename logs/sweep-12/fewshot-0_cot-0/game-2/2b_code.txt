The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code need to be fixed for the game to compile correctly. Here is the repaired code:

```

Explanation of the changes:

1. **RULES Section**
   - Added `|` in the resulting state of the gem collection rule to specify the state after the player collects the gem, ensuring that the transformation correctly leaves an empty space.
   - The syntax `SFX gemCollect` is used to trigger the sound effect.

2. **Removed invalid references**
   - There was no need for referring to "movement" explicitly since it isn't defined as a rule label, so I ensured that rules are defined with correct predicates.

These adjustments ensure that the syntax correctly aligns with the expected structure for PuzzleScript without introducing undefined components or syntax errors.
