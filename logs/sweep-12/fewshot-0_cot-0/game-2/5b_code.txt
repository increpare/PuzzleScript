Here is the repaired version of your PuzzleScript code. The errors have been addressed:

1. Comment lines have been removed from the `RULES` section, because comments are not allowed within the rules.
2. Corrected the extra whitespace in the right movement rule that was causing the parsing issue.

This should now work correctly in PuzzleScript without compilation errors.
