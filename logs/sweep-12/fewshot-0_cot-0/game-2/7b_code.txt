Let's address the issues in the provided code:

1. **Sound Event Issue**: The sound section has a placeholder, but it needs to be associated correctly or omitted if not used.
2. **Comment Syntax in Rules**: The comment syntax you're using in the rules section isn't valid in PuzzleScript.
3. **Unnamed References in Errors**: Errors mention invalid references, perhaps caused by the incorrect comments.

Here's a fixed version of the code:

```

### Key Changes Made:

- **Sound Section**: Retained as a placeholder but correctly placed. If not needed, this section can also be removed entirely.
- **Rule Comments Removed**: Removed informal comment syntax from the rules to avoid any parsing issues.
- **Correct Rule Syntax**: Adjusted the rule syntax to ensure it's valid and does not include any errant references to comments.
