Here's what was fixed:
- Removed the "SOUNDS" block because PuzzleScript does not currently support a dedicated sound command or block for sound files.
- Corrected the transformation rules so each pattern on the left has an equivalent pattern on the right. Specifically, the converted CrateOnTarget rules were not balanced. They now transform CrateOnTarget correctly.
