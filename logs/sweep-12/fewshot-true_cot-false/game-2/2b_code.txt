### Explanation:
The original rule `[Box | Button] -> [ Background ] sfx1` was incorrect because it did not have a corresponding button on the right-hand side. Each element on the left must have a corresponding element on the right with the same pattern size, so the rule `[Box | Button] -> [ Background | Button ] sfx1` aligns the rule correctly.
