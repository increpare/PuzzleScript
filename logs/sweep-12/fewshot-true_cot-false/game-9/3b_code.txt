Certainly! Let's address the errors in your code. The main issues were related to incorrect object names in collision layers and rules. Here's the corrected version:

### Changes Made:
1. **Defined `Target` and `Crate`:** Added `Target` and `Crate` in the `LEGEND` section to correctly define them.
2. **Fixed the Rules:** Ensured that the rules use the correct object names (`Crate` instead of `crate`).
3. **Removed SFX Error:** Moved SFX outside of the main rule checks to prevent syntax issues.
  
This should resolve the compilation errors and allow the game to work as expected.
