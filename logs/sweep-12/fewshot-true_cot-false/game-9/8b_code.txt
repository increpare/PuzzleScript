To address the issue where Level 2 is not solvable, let's carefully review your PuzzleScript code and make appropriate changes to fix the problem. It's possible that the configuration of crates, targets, and obstacles is resulting in the unsolvability of the level. I'll adjust Level 2 to ensure that it's solvable while maintaining the intended gameplay.

Here's the updated code with a solvable Level 2:

In the original Level 2, the placement might have caused an unsolvable scenario. By ensuring proper spacing and rearranging the objects, the level should be solvable. Make sure the layout allows the player enough room to maneuver the crates onto their respective targets. Feel free to test the adjusted level to ensure it's working as expected.
