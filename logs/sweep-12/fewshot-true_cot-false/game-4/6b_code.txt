### Changes Made:
1. **COLLISIONLAYERS Section**: Added the missing `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to define object layers.
2. **Rules Section**: Added a sample rule to showcase basic player movement onto the target. You might need to expand this based on your game's requirements.
3. **Win Conditions**: Corrected syntax and ensured the win condition checks for the Player being on the Target. 
4. Checked the player character exists per the legend and object definitions. 

This should fix the errors and allow the game to run correctly. Adjust the `RULES` as needed to match your intended gameplay.
