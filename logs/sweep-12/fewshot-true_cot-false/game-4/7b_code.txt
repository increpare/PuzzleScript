### Key Changes:
1. Added a `SOUNDS` section to follow the required section order.
2. Corrected the rule to properly use object names recognized by the system (`No Player | Target` for player interaction with targets).
3. Modified the rule to ensure that it conforms to valid syntax and object existence queries.
4. Altered the win condition to use correct syntax and object names.
