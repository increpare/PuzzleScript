Certainly! Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I have fixed the sprite dimensions and adjusted the rules and win conditions that incorrectly assumed overlapping of non-overlapping objects.

In this corrected version:
1. I've added the background graphics that were missing.
2. I've ensured that graphic dimensions for all objects are 5x5.
3. Adjusted the collision layers to allow the correct interaction where possible, while considering the immovable nature of certain layers.
4. The win condition must ensure that a player "charges" a charger by placing a battery on it without physically overlapping, which needs to be checked in gameplay logic outside of PuzzleScript or can be adjusted to a logical equivalent in win conditions if feasible.
5. I've included a sample sound definition to resolve sound-related compilation errors. Adjust further as necessary.
