Here's the repaired version of the code. The errors were caused by incorrect color indices in the `Battery` and `Charger` object definitions. Each color should be defined separately in the object's color palette. I've fixed these issues:

Changes made:
1. In the `Battery` object, a second color `Black` was added for the edge of the objects.
2. In the `Charger` object, a second color `LightGreen` was added to provide contrast.
