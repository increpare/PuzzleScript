Certainly! The errors in the provided code are related to color palette issues for the `Wall` and `Box` objects. To fix these errors, I will ensure that the color palette for each object matches the number of colors referenced in the object's sprite patterns. Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Key Fixes:
1. **Wall**: Previously, the `Wall` object was trying to reference additional colors that were not defined. The original color palette had one color, which was correct. Thus, I removed all extra color fields.
   
2. **Box**: The `Box` object now has three colors defined (#3cb44b, #006B3C, #2E8B57) to match the reference numbers in its sprite pattern. This resolves the error regarding accessing an undefined color in the sprite.

With these changes, the code should compile and run without producing color-related errors.
