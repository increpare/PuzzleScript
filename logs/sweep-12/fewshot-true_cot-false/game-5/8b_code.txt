In this corrected version, I've adjusted the color definitions for `Wall` and `Goal`. For `Wall`, since there was initially only one color defined but many color palette entries attempted, I've retained the single color, making sure it's consistently used. For `Goal`, I've introduced a second color to match the attempted palette entries in the object definition.
