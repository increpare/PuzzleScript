Here are the changes and fixes that were applied:

1. **Treasure Object Color Correction**: The color assignment for the Treasure object should not have an empty space before it. It was corrected to `gold yellow`.

2. **Hero Sprite Colors**: The Hero sprite was trying to access undefined colors. This was corrected by using only two colors, matching with the color palette limitations given in the OBJECTS section.

3. **Rectangular Level Maps**: Ensure all level rows are of the same length by adding or removing spaces as necessary.

4. **Ellipsis Rule Correction**: Corrected the ellipsis usage in RULES to not be at the start or end and placed correctly to ensure it is meaningful as required.

With these changes, the game should compile correctly without errors.
