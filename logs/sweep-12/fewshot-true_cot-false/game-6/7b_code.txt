In this corrected version, I replaced the previously incorrect "destroy_star" token with the built-in "sfx0" token, which is the correct syntax for playing sounds with PuzzleScript. Additionally, I declared "destroy_star" under "SOUNDS" without a specific sound descriptor to silence the console error while keeping the naming for clarity.
