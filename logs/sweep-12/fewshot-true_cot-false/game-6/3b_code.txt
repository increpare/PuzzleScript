Here's a corrected version of the code for the "Star Collector" game. I've addressed the issues with the sound and rule syntax:

```

Changes made:
1. Adjusted the `SOUNDS` section to use the sound verb `DESTROY` with the appropriate syntax.
2. Corrected the rules to properly reference the sound effect when the player collects a star. Removed the object reference in the rule action, as you only need to mention the sound.
3. Ensured the collision layers are correctly ordered so the player can overlap with stars.
