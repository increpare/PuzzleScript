Changes made:
- Corrected "move sound" to "Move" to match PuzzleScript's expected sound descriptions.
- Removed "move" from the rule since sound triggers are managed by their own keywords.
- Removed unreferenced "target" sound call in the rules.
- Fixed possible rule-matching issues by checking alignment with puzzle conditions.
