I replaced the unrecognized soundverb "REACH" with "REACHED" for sound events in the SOUNDS section and added a sound effect at the end of "[ LightSource | Target ] -> [ LightSource | LightSource ]" with a generic placeholder "SFX1" to provide proper syntax for sound playing. Please make sure the sound id matches an existing one in your assets.
