The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the color palette specified for the "Crate" object in the game. Specifically, the colors "Orange" and "DarkOrange" are not recognized by PuzzleScript, leading to issues when trying to access those colors.

The plan is to:
1. Replace "Orange" and "DarkOrange" with standard PuzzleScript colors that are recognized by the engine.
2. Update the color definitions in the "Crate" object to ensure proper visualization.
3. Verify that the rest of the color codes and rules align correctly.

Let's replace "Orange" with "Orange" (if available, otherwise another recognized color like "Yellow") and "DarkOrange" with "Red" or another dark variant of a color:
