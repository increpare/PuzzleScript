When designing a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define key elements of the game: objects, rules, collision layers, win conditions, and levels. I'll create a simple Sokoban-like puzzle game involving a player, walls, crates, and targets. The goal is to push all crates onto the targets to win. Here's how I'll structure the game:

1. **Title and Author**: Establish a name and author for the new game.
2. **Objects**: Define the visual representation and color of each object.
3. **Legend**: Create shorthand symbols for objects for easy level design.
4. **Collision Layers**: Specify how objects interact within the game grid.
5. **Rules**: Define object behavior and game logic, including movement rules and interactions.
6. **Win Conditions**: Set what conditions must be satisfied to consider the level complete.
7. **Levels**: Design a few levels with increasing difficulty to provide a gameplay challenge.

**Explanation**:
- **Objects**: We've defined a player, walls, crates, and targets, each with a unique color and pattern.
- **Legend**: We define concise symbols to use in level descriptions.
- **Collision Layers**: Objects are arranged to determine collision priorities.
- **Rules**: The primary rule allows the player to push a crate. If the player encounters a wall, movement is blocked.
- **Win Conditions**: The level is won when all crates are on targets.
- **Levels**: Three example levels are provided with progressive difficulty, represented using the defined symbols. The player must push all crates onto the targets to complete each level.

This game design encapsulates the core mechanics of Sokoban, with the provided levels offering a basic challenge to test these mechanics.
