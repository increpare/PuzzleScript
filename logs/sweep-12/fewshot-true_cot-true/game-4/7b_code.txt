Modifications made:

1. Updated the `RULES` section for moving Crate:
   - Adjusted rule to prevent the player from trying to push the crate into a wall or another crate.

By refining these rules and checking your crate positioning relative to the walls and targets, the level should be solvable now. Please test it to ensure everything works as expected in a working environment.
