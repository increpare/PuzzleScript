The issue you're facing indicates that there is an error with the solvability of Level 0 in your PuzzleScript game. The other levels appear solvable, but Level 0 might not lead to a win, possibly due to an unreachable target or crate stuck situation.

Let's go through the potentially problematic parts and suggest a modification to ensure the level is solvable:

1. Ensure that all targets are reachable and can hold crates.
2. Avoid placing walls in a way that crates can get stuck without having a clear path to the targets.

Here's the updated code:

I've modified Level 0 to ensure that the crate and target are accessible. Please consider testing these changes to ensure the game behaves as intended. Make sure each level design allows the player to move crates onto the targets without any blockage.
