To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider several key elements: 

1. **Title and Metadata**: Define the title, author, and other metadata for the game. This will give the game a sense of identity.
   
2. **Objects**: Define the different entities that will exist in the game world. This will include the player, obstacles, targets, and any other items that will feature in the game.

3. **Legend**: Simplify the game representation by assigning character symbols to objects, making it easier to design levels.

4. **Sounds**: Define any sound effects that are used in different game actions or states.

5. **Collision Layers**: Specify the rendering order and how different entities interact.

6. **Rules**: Establish the game mechanics, determining how entities interact with each other in response to player inputs.

7. **Win Conditions**: Define the conditions required for a player to complete a level.

8. **Levels**: Design different levels, applying the legend and rules to provide challenges for the player.

9. **Messages**: Use messages for level descriptions or congratulatory messages.

Based on these components, I'll outline a simple block-pushing game. The player needs to move crates onto targets, a concept similar to Sokoban. We'll define a few levels, sounds, and a simple win condition.

message Congratulations, you completed all levels!
```

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: This section defines the appearance and colors of the game's items.
- **Legend**: Symbols are assigned to each object for easy level creation.
- **Rules**: Define how the player interacts with crates, specifically moving them. Crates on targets are marked.
- **Win Conditions**: The player needs all crates on targets to win.
- **Levels**: Include several levels with different crate and target positions.
- **Messages**: Display a message at the end of the first level and a congratulatory message upon completing all levels. 

This provides a basic framework for a block-pushing puzzle game. Adjustments can be made for aesthetics, mechanics, or level complexity.
