To address the error message reported in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that every rule on the left-hand side has a corresponding match on the right-hand side with an equal number of cells. This is a requirement in PuzzleScript to maintain consistency between actions defined for specific game objects. 

The error occurs in the rule:

```plaintext
[ Crate | Target ] -> [ @ ]
```

The rule attempts to replace a configuration of a Crate on a Target with a single tile, `@`. This suggests a mismatch in the number of cells between the left-hand and right-hand sides. Each pattern on the left-hand side should correspond to an equal-sized pattern or a replacement on the right side.

To fix this, we need to modify the rule so that both sides have the same number of cells. Here's the corrected rule:

```plaintext
[ Crate | Target ] -> [ @ | Background ]
```

This maintains the number of cells but effectively transforms a Crate on a Target into a combined state represented by `@` and fills the adjacent cell with `Background`.

Below is the complete code with the corrected rule:

With this modification, the rule now correctly matches and updates the state of the game while preserving the game's logic and objectives.
