To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we'll need to adhere to the structure of a standard PuzzleScript game, with specific sections for the title, author, objects, rules, collision layers, win conditions, and levels. PuzzleScript games are often puzzle-based and revolve around moving a player character and interacting with objects in the environment. We'll create a simple puzzle game where the player must navigate through a maze and reach a goal. The game will include walls (obstacles), a goal (target), and a player.

### Plan:
1. **Title and Author**: Create a title and author section to identify the game.
2. **Objects**: Define the objects in the game, such as the player, walls, background, and target.
3. **Legend**: Assign symbols to the objects for easy reference in levels.
4. **Sounds**: Define any sounds associated with object interactions (optional for this simple game).
5. **Collision Layers**: Set the order of interaction for objects in the game.
6. **Rules**: Define how the player can interact with objects and any movement rules.
7. **Win Conditions**: Specify how the player can win the game.
8. **Levels**: Design one or more levels that incorporate the defined objects and rules.

### Explanation:
- **Title and Author**: Identified the game with a clear title and author's name.
- **Objects**: Defined four simple objects: Background, Wall, Player, and Goal, each visually distinct.
- **Legend**: Mapped symbols to objects to simplify level design.
- **Sounds**: Included basic sounds for starting and ending the game.
- **Collision Layers**: Specified that the player can move over the background but is blocked by walls.
- **Rules**: Created simple interaction rules where the player cannot move through walls and reaching the goal ends the game.
- **Win Conditions**: Defined winning as placing the player on the goal.
- **Levels**: Designed a simple introductory level using the defined symbols and rules. 

This structure and code create a basic yet complete puzzle game in PuzzleScript. You can expand this with more levels, objects, and complexity if desired.
