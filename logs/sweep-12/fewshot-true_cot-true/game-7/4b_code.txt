The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code are related to the handling of sounds. In PuzzleScript, sound identifiers should be properly associated with actions, but it seems like the sound "finishgame" is not correctly implemented, and it should not be included in the rule definitions directly. Here's how we can fix the code:

1. **Remove the "finishgame" sound**: PuzzleScript doesn't support calling a sound directly in the rules like that. You need to associate sounds with actions like movements or completion messages, or use predefined events.

2. **Modify the Win Condition**: Ensure that the win condition correctly captures when the player reaches the goal.

3. **Refactor Out the Sound Usage**: As there is no direct way to trigger a sound on reaching the goal without a predefined event, we either need to remove it or use a game message where sounds can be indirectly implied.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

In this version, I've removed the "finishgame" sound, as PuzzleScript does not support custom named sounds being triggered directly. Instead, you can use inbuilt sounds such as victory sound associated with win conditions and try triggering them via message screens, or simply rely on text messages to imply the game's conclusion. The rules now focus on moving through the maze without incorporating any custom sound triggers that don't exist by default in PuzzleScript.
