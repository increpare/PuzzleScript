The console errors in the provided PuzzleScript game are related to the incorrect handling of sound effects. The error messages indicate that:

1. The `finish` sound has been defined incorrectly.
2. The placement and usage of the `finish` sound is not appropriate in the context of the PuzzleScript language rules.

To address these errors:

- We need to define the sound appropriately under the `SOUNDS` section.
- Adjust the rule where the 'finish' sound is called, ensuring itâ€™s associated properly with gameplay actions or conditions.

Here is the revised version of your code with corrections:

### Changes Made:
- The `finish` sound is declared in the `SOUNDS` section correctly (line 21-22).
- Retain the `finish` sound trigger in the second rule to play the sound effect when the player reaches the goal (line 49).
  
Ensure that these changes align with the exact error messages and behavior you want to achieve in your game. Test the game after implementing these changes to confirm that it works as expected.
