The provided code for the PuzzleScript game "Simple Maze Adventure" has a few errors related to sprite definitions. The error messages indicate that the game is trying to access color indices in sprites that have not been properly defined. When defining sprites, you must ensure that the number of colors you specify matches the number you are trying to use within the sprite matrix.

Here's a plan of action to fix these issues:

1. **Define Correct Colors for Sprites**: Ensure that the color palette for each sprite (Wall and Player) is correctly set up with sufficient colors.

2. **Correct Indices in Sprite Matrices**: Ensure that the indices used in the sprite matrices correspond to defined colors.

Given the error messages, it seems you've attempted to use indices outside the range of the defined colors for the Wall and Player objects. Let's correct this by defining enough colors for each sprite, ensuring we adjust the sprite matrices to reference the defined colors correctly.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

### Changes Made:
1. **Wall Sprite**: Added a second color in the palette for `Wall` to allow usage of `1` in the sprite matrix. The color `white` is added to allow the three `1`s to be used.

2. **Player Sprite**: Added a second color (`green`) in the palette for the `Player` sprite and changed all `1`s to `2` to allow usage of a second color in the matrix.

With these corrections, each sprite references a defined color in its palette, resolving the errors and ensuring the game compiles correctly.
