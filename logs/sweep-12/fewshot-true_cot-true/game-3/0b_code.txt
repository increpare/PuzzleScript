To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define a few essential components: the title, author, objects, legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. The goal will be to make a simple, yet complete and functional game that demonstrates the PuzzleScript capabilities.

Here's the plan:
1. Define a simple game title and author.
2. Create a few objects for the game, such as the player, walls, ground, and an exit or goal.
3. Establish the legend to map characters to these objects.
4. Set up collision layers to define which objects can interact with each other.
5. Define rules for player movement and interactions.
6. Specify win conditions, for example, when the player reaches the goal.
7. Create a few levels to make the game playable.

I'll design a straightforward game in which the player navigates a maze and must reach the goal.

This basic game features:
- A `Player` object that you can control.
- `Walls` around which the player must navigate.
- A `Goal` that the player needs to reach to win.
- `Background` serves as the empty traversable ground.
- Rules for movement allow the player to move into the background but not into the walls.
- Two simple levels with different maze layouts to solve. 

This setup provides the essential structure for a PuzzleScript game, ensuring it is both playable and complete.
