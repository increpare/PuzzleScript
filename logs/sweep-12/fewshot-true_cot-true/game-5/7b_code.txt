To fix the errors, let's analyze each issue:

1. **Line 74 - Unexpected token:** This is because there is a comment inside the SOUNDS section. We should remove the comment.

2. **Line 101 and 103 - Non-rectangular map:** This is because the map rows have different lengths. We need to ensure all rows have the same number of symbols.

3. **Line 51 - Sprite size mismatch:** The "Door" sprite is not 5x5. We need to make sure it is 5x5.

4. **Line 100 - Unknown symbol " ":** Spaces are not defined as background in the LEGEND. We should use "." for empty spaces.

Let's fix these issues by making necessary corrections:

What I did:
- Removed the comment from the `SOUNDS` section.
- Fixed the sprite size for "Door" to make it 5x5 by adding two dots in each line to ensure it fits the requirement.
- Made sure the level maps are rectangular by adjusting the rows to have the same number of characters.
- Replaced spaces with "." to represent the background more accurately.
