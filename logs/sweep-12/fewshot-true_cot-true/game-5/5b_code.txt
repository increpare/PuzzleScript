To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to make several changes:

1. **Rectangular Levels:** Ensure all level lines are of equal length.
2. **Sprite Dimensions:** Ensure that all sprites have a size of 5x5 pixels.
3. **Undefined Symbol:** The space character `" "` is used in the map but hasn't been defined in the legend, hence we need to map it to `Background` using a legend definition.

Let's resolve these issues:

1. **Adjust sprite dimensions:** Sprites for `Door` and `OpenDoor` need to be adjusted to 5x5.
2. **Ensure uniform level length:** Make sure each level line contains the same number of characters.
3. **Define space as Background:** Add space `" "` to the legend to equate to `Background`.

Here's the corrected code:

- **Sprite Dimensions:** The door sprites have been made 5x5 by adding additional dots (.)
- **Level Rectangularity:** Each row in the level is the same length to satisfy the rectangular map requirement.
- **Background Symbol:** The space `" "` is now associated with `Background` in the legend to avoid undefined symbols.
