The errors in the provided code are due to the use of the `#` character in the levels, which is not defined in the legend or objects section. In PuzzleScript, the `#` symbol is typically used to represent walls or borders that are impassable. Since this object is not defined, the compiler throws an error.

To fix the errors, we need to:

1. Define a new object for walls in the `OBJECTS` section.
2. Add an entry to the `LEGEND` section to map the `#` character to the wall object.

Let's add these definitions to the code:

In this fixed version, I've added a `Wall` object with a black color and updated the `LEGEND` section to include the `Wall` object, represented by the `#` character. This change ensures that the game correctly recognizes the `#` character as walls in the levels.
