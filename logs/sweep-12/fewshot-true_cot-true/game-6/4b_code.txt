To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript code, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Sound Verb Error**: The `REMOVE` keyword in the sound section is incorrect. The correct sound verbs are `MOVE`, `DESTROY`, `CANTMOVE`, etc. Since we're dealing with the removal of an `EnergyOrb`, we should use the verb `DESTROY`.

2. **Object Reference in Rules**: The error at line 80 indicates that there's a reference to `REMOVE` within a rule. The rule there is malformed, as `REMOVE` is not a valid action within rules. Instead, we should use `> Alien` to replace `Alien` when the `Alien` collects the `EnergyOrb`.

3. **Missing Player Declaration**: The error mentions that there is no player defined. We need to ensure that `Alien` is defined as the player in the game. We'll do this by adding an entry in the `LEGEND` section that defines `P` as `Player`.

Let's integrate these changes into the PuzzleScript code to resolve the errors:

The changes made address the errors in the source code:
- The `EnergyOrb` `REMOVE` keyword was changed to `DESTROY` in the `SOUNDS` section.
- The rule with `REMOVE` was corrected to properly remove the `EnergyOrb` once collected.
- The `Player` was defined as an alias for `Alien` under the `LEGEND` section.
