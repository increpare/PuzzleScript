To address the errors highlighted in the console output, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Wall Color Error**: The `Wall` object has one color defined (`grey`). However, the code tries to access additional colors, which does not exist. Based on the error message, we need to update the `Wall` object to utilize just one color.

2. **Block Color Error**: The error indicates a parsing issue due to the extra dot in `blue.darkblue`. This should be split into two separate colors, `blue` and `darkblue`.

Let's implement these changes:

1. Remove the unnecessary color references from the `Wall` object.
2. Correct the color specification for the `Block`.

Here's the corrected code:

This revised code should resolve the compilation errors mentioned and allow the game to compile and run correctly.
