To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we should carefully examine the color definitions and ensure that the palettes defined for each object contain the correct number of colors specified.

The reported errors indicate problems with color palette definitions for the "Wall" and "Block" objects:

1. For the "Wall" object, the error suggests trying to access a color beyond the defined range. We need to ensure the color palette definition corresponds with the color values used in the sprite design.

2. Similarly, there is a similar issue with the "Block" object, where its color palette definition doesn't match the colors referenced by its sprite.

Here is the plan to fix these issues:

- Correct the number of colors in the palette definitions and ensure that the patterns in the sprite definitions use only available color indices.

Now, let's provide a fixed version of the code:

Key changes made:

- Changed the color definition for the "Block" object's sprite from `111.` to `000.` to ensure the colors are within the range.
- Renamed and added multiple shades for the "Block" object to allow different color indices for increased flexibility with sprite design.
  
These changes should resolve the issues and allow the game code to compile correctly.
