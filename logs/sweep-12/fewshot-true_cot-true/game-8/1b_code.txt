To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we have to perform two main tasks:

1. **Fix the color_palette declaration**: It seems the color palette declaration is causing issues as the system does not recognize it correctly. Typically, PuzzleScript games define colors directly in the OBJECTS section and do not have a dedicated color_palette block. We'll remove this block and instead ensure that colors for the objects are correctly defined in the OBJECTS section.

2. **Correct the WALL object definition**: The error messages indicate that the Wall object only has one color defined, where it expects more for the 5x5 pattern. We'll define the Wall using a proper pattern.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

**Explanation of Changes:**
- Removed the `color_palette` block since it is unconventional and causing issues.
- Added colors directly in the `OBJECTS` section to ensure correct parsing.
- Correctly defined Wall with multiple color numbers in the OBJECT grid to match its defined pattern. 

These changes should allow the game to compile without errors and function as intended.
