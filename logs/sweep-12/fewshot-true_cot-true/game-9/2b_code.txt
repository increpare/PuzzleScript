Upon reviewing the error messages, it is clear that the issue lies with how sounds are defined and referenced within the PuzzleScript code. In the PuzzleScript language, sound effects must be declared using a specific format, and they can't be called directly by name in rules but instead by their defined numbers (or indices). Here's a step-by-step plan to fix the code:

1. Properly declare sound effects using the `sfx??` format, where `??` is a unique two-digit identifier.
2. In the rules section, replace the sound names with their appropriate numeric identifiers.
3. Ensure each sound effect is correctly mapped to a number, which is how PuzzleScript references sounds.

Now, I'll provide the corrected and complete version of the code:

In this corrected version, the sound effects are declared with `sfx0`, `sfx1`, and `sfx2`, and the rules reference these indices instead of direct sound names.
