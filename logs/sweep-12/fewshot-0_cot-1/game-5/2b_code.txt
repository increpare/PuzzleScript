Let's address the issues one by one based on the console output and the typical structure of a PuzzleScript game.

### Issues to Address:

1. **Section Order:** The SOUNDS section is incorrectly placed before LEGEND. The correct order is OBJECTS, LEGEND, COLLISIONLAYERS, RULES, WINCONDITIONS, SOUNDS, LEVELS.

2. **Comment in RULES Section:** PuzzleScript does not natively support comment lines within sections like RULES by using `#`. Such comments must be removed to avoid being mistakenly parsed as rules.

### Plan of Action:

- Move the SOUNDS section to its correct position after WINCONDITIONS.
- Remove the in-line comment from the RULES section that caused the syntax error.

Here is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

```plaintext
===========
OBJECTS
===========
Background
WHITE

Wall
BLACK

Player
BLUE

Box
RED

Target
YELLOW

============
LEGEND
============
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target

===============
COLLISIONLAYERS
===============
Background
Player, Box
Wall, Target

========
RULES
========
[Player | Box] -> [ > Player | > Box] 

========
WINCONDITIONS
========
All Box on Target

=======
SOUNDS
=======

=======
LEVELS
=======
#####
#...#
#.T.#
#BTP#
#...#
#####

######
#.T..#
#..B.#
#PT..#
#.T..#
######
```

By addressing these errors, the code should now compile and execute correctly within the PuzzleScript environment.
