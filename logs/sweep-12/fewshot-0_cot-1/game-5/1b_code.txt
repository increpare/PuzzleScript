The error messages indicate a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Section Order**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is out of order. In PuzzleScript, the section order is crucial and typically follows a specific sequence. It seems the `SOUNDS` section is missing, even if it's empty.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: PuzzleScript is case-sensitive, so object names used in rules and legend should match the case defined in the `OBJECTS` section. The error mentions "Name 'player'" and "Name 'box'", which likely refers to the lowercase usage not matching the objects defined as "Player" and "Box".

3. **Commenting Rules**: The comment line incorrectly breaks into tokens, expecting rule components due to missing parts of the comment syntax.

To fix these errors, I will:

1. Insert an empty `SOUNDS` section to ensure correct section order.
2. Correct the rule by matching the case of object names with those defined in the `OBJECTS` section.
3. Ensure any comments in the rules are properly prefixed with a hash (#) with correct syntax.

Here's the corrected code:

```plaintext

These corrections should resolve the compilation errors by ensuring correct section order, addressing case sensitivity issues, and proper commenting.
