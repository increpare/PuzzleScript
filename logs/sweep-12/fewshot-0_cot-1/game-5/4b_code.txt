In order to make the second level solvable, we need to ensure that every box can reach a target. Here is the corrected code with an adjustment to the second level:

```plaintext
===========
OBJECTS
===========
Background
WHITE

Wall
BLACK

Player
BLUE

Box
RED

Target
YELLOW

============
LEGEND
============
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
T = Target

=======
SOUNDS
=======

===============
COLLISIONLAYERS
===============
Background
Player, Box
Wall, Target

========
RULES
========
[Player | Box] -> [ > Player | > Box] 

========
WINCONDITIONS
========
All Box on Target

=======
LEVELS
=======
#####
#...#
#.T.#
#BTP#
#...#
#####

######
#.T..#
#..B.#
#P.T.#
#.T..#
######

```

In this corrected version, I've moved the position of certain elements in the second level to ensure that the box has a clear path to reach the target.
