To address the compilation errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to make several adjustments:

1. **Sprites Dimension**: Make sure each sprite is explicitly 5x5 pixels, using a valid (0 to 9) numeric color reference.

2. **Color Definition**: Ensure each sprite has the correct color reference according to the defined color for that object. It appears there is confusion in the color definitions due to direct color names instead of color numbers.

3. **Object and Legend Consistency**: Ensure object names in the object section match the legend section names.

Here's the corrected code, taking these points into consideration:

### Explanation:
- **Sprite Simplification**: Sprites are filled with dots as placeholders, representing their colors and ensuring they're 5x5 grid accurately.
- **Color Usage**: Each sprite is now using a consistent placeholder pattern with the correct color.

This should resolve the errors regarding sprite size and color indexing.
