Based on the errors in the console output, it appears that the format of the game description is incorrect. PuzzleScript uses specific sections for defining objects and rules, and these sections are separated by specific keywords. The error suggests misuse of the `=` character which is meant for separating sections, but the incorrect usage in the `= OBJECTS =` and similar headers caused the parser to misunderstand the structure.

To fix the errors:
1. Remove the equal signs (`=`) surrounding the section headers and replace them with simple section headers.
2. Ensure that all object, legend, etc., are listed properly under their respective headers without additional characters such as `=` signs.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

This corrected code should compile properly without errors, as the sections are clearly defined according to the PuzzleScript language specifications.
