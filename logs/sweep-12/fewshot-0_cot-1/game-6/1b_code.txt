To resolve the errors, it's important to understand the likely issues with the provided code based on the PuzzleScript convention. The PuzzleScript language has a specific structure for its game definition with clearly defined sections for objects, legend, collision layers, rules, win conditions, and levels. The errors suggest that there's some unrecognized content or possibly misplaced items within sections. The `Objects` section, for example, needs to specify a name, color, and optionally a character map.

Here's a step-by-step plan to fix the issues:

1. **Correct the `Objects` Section**: Ensure that each object is clearly defined starting with an object name followed by optional color and glyph data. The `title` and `author` information should not be inside the `Objects` section.

2. **Organize the Title and Author**: These should be correctly placed outside of any section.

3. **Verify Syntax**: After placing the title and ensuring the object definitions are correct, confirm that other sections like `Legend`, `CollisionLayers`, and others adhere to the proper syntax as well.

Here's the corrected code:

The revised version places the `title` and `author` at the correct place (before section definitions), maintains proper hierarchy, and correctly follows the PuzzleScript format. Now it should compile without errors, assuming no other unseen issues exist.
