To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider several elements:

1. **Title and Author:** Define the game title and the author.
2. **Objects:** Specify the sprite designs that will represent individual game elements such as the player, goal, walls, and any other interactive or non-interactive objects.
3. **Legend:** Map the characters in the level definition to these objects.
4. **Sound:** Define sound effects for game actions.
5. **Collision Layers:** Establish the hierarchy of objects to manage which objects can overlap.
6. **Rules:** Define how the objects interact with one another and how they move based on player input.
7. **Win Conditions:** Set conditions under which the game or levels are considered complete.
8. **Levels:** Design the level layout using characters from the Legend.

Let's create a simple puzzle game named "Sokoban Simple" where the player pushes boxes onto targets. This type of game is straightforward yet showcases object interaction and win conditions effectively.

### Explanation:

- **Objects:** We define five objects: `Background`, `Player`, `Wall`, `Box`, `Target`, and a combined state `BoxOnTarget`.
- **Legend:** Maps symbols like `P` to `Player` in levels for easy representation.
- **Collision Layers:** Establishes which objects can exist separately or overlap, preventing illegal movements such as walking through walls.
- **Rules:** Define how the player interacts with the boxes. Specifically, the player can push a box into an empty space or onto a target. Likewise, a box leaving a target reverts to a regular box.
- **Win Conditions:** All boxes must be on the target spots for the game to declare a win.
- **Levels:** Creates a simple level layout that employs all defined elements, providing a straightforward puzzle.

This setup creates a foundational Sokoban-style game, showcasing basic movement, object interaction, and win conditions in PuzzleScript.
