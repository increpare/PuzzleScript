The error messages indicated that the sprite matrices for the `Player` and `Box` objects contain incorrect characters, specifically `@` and `B`. In PuzzleScript, sprite matrices use special characters to represent objects on a grid, with each character representing a different object or feature such as player, box, background, etc. The sprite matrices should only contain `.` (or spaces) to represent transparent spaces or parts of the object's colors, not functional game piece symbols like `@` or `B`.

Here's a revised version of the game code with the corrected sprite definitions:

In this corrected version, every unintended character is replaced with `0` to represent the object within its respective colored area. The other sections remain unchanged, ensuring the game's logic and structure work as intended.
