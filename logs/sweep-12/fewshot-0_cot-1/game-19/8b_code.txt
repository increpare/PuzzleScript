The error messages point out that the rule patterns on the left and right sides are not of equal length in the specified lines. In PuzzleScript, when you define transformation rules, each pattern (a series of object representations within square brackets) on the left side of a transformation must have a matching pattern of the same size on the right side. 

Let's look at the problematic rules:

1. ```[Player | Box] -> [Player | . | Box]```: The left side has two cells (Player and Box) and the right side has three. This is incorrect and should be fixed.

2. ```[Player | BoxOnTarget] -> [Player | . | BoxOnTarget]```: Similarly, the left side has two cells and the right side has three. This is also incorrect.

The goal seems to allow the player to push boxes forward, and the implementation is trying to decompose a movement involving the player next to a box, which is fine, but we need to ensure that the right side of each rule matches the left in size.

Let's fix these issues by correctly matching the length of patterns across the transformations:

Here's what was adjusted:
- Each rule was updated to ensure that the pattern lengths on both sides of the `->` operator are equal.
- The rules are changed so that each segment being matched and transformed in the patterns correctly describes the intended movements, pushing boxes when adjacent to the player.

These changes should fix the reported errors and ensure the game behaves as intended.
