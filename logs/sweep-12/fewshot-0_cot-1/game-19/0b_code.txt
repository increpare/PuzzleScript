Creating a complete PuzzleScript game involves several components, including defining the title, author information, various game objects, rules, levels, and potentially some win conditions. Our goal is to create a simple yet complete PuzzleScript-based puzzle game.

Let's break down the process:
1. **Meta Information**: Define the title and author of the game.
2. **Objects**: Define the sprites that will be present in the game. These usually include the player, walls, goals, and other necessary objects, such as boxes or targets in a Sokoban-style game.
3. **Legend**: Establish what each character in the level maps to in terms of objects.
4. **Sounds**: Define any sound effects for various events.
5. **Collision Layers**: Organize the objects into layers that determine what can be on the same tile at the same time.
6. **Rules**: Specify how the game reacts to player input; i.e., how objects move and interact.
7. **Win Conditions**: Define what conditions must be met for a level to be considered complete.
8. **Levels**: Create some levels for the game, using the defined objects and rules.

For this exercise, let's stick with a simple and classic Sokoban-style game. The player must push boxes onto target spaces.

Here's how the complete code might look:

### Explanation:

- **Meta Information**: Simple metadata for the game.
- **Objects**: Defined a player, wall, box, target, and a compound object for a box on target.
- **Legend**: Connect each character used in level design with an in-game object.
- **Collision Layers**: Specify which objects can stack and which cannot.
- **Rules**: Basic movement rules are established, allowing players to push boxes and interact with targets.
- **Win Conditions**: The player wins if all boxes are on targets.
- **Levels**: Two simple levels demonstrating the concept. Players must push boxes onto targets to complete levels.

This pseudo Sokoban game can be expanded with more levels and additional game mechanics, such as multiple boxes and players or more complex level structures.
