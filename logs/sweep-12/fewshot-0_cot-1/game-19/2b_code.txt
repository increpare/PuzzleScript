The provided code contains several issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Sprite Size Error**: All sprites must be exactly 5x5. The current sprite definitions for `Player`, `Wall`, `Box`, `Target`, and `BoxOnTarget` do not meet this requirement.

2. **Color Definitions**: The color definition for `BoxOnTarget` has been provided incorrectly. The same object should not appear multiple times in different sections, as seen for `BoxOnTarget`.

3. **Rule Length Mismatch**: In a rule, the patterns on the left must match the length of those on the right for each cell. We should ensure that the rule patterns are of equal lengths.

The revised code should address these issues by ensuring all sprites are 5x5 and that rules are correctly matched. Let's rewrite the code to fix these issues:

**Changes made:**
- Updated all sprites to be 5x5.
- Fixed color issue by ensuring `BoxOnTarget` color is defined correctly.
- Adjusted the rules to match cell patterns on both sides equally.
- Ensure the rules correctly represent the intended behavior by matching existing game mechanics standards.
