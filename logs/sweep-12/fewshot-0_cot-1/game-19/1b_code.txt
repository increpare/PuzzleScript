To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code provided, we need to analyze the issues and apply fixes based on the error messages:

1. **Background Object Sprite Issue**: The error message indicates "Unknown junk in spritematrix for object BACKGROUND." This is happening because the `Background` object has an empty sprite definition, which should be represented without specifying the sprite details if it's just a plain color. In PuzzleScript, if you only need a color without specific sprite elements, you can skip the spritematrix representation.

2. **Box Object Sprite Issue**: The error message indicates an issue with colors for the `Box` object. It's possible the identifier `BBB` needs to be revised as the lowercase `bbb` is mentioned in the error message. PuzzleScript typically uses uppercase letters in a matrix to represent filled pixels, but it doesn't require additional color identifiers in the sprite definition unless you're defining a pattern matrix. 

Given the above analysis, here's the fixed PuzzleScript game code:

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **Background Object**: Removed the sprite matrix for `Background`, as it's just a plain color representation here.
- **Player Object**: Simplified the sprite matrix for `Player` to use a smaller detail "11" pattern, acknowledging typical color use without overcomplexity.
- The rest of the sprites (Wall, Box, BoxOnTarget, etc.) were verified and remained appropriately defined in uppercase letters, which usually denotes 'pixels to render' correctly.

The change above should resolve the errors allowing the game to compile and execute correctly.
