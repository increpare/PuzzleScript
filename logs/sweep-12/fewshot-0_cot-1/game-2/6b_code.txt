Alright, let's address the issues identified from the console output. The errors suggest issues in understanding the lines provided in the 'OBJECTS' and 'LEGEND' sections of the code. 

In PuzzleScript, the 'LEGEND' section is typically used to create aliases or for compositional purposes on how elements interact rather than defining mappings for single characters. Given the error messages, it seems the engine does not recognize the way the characters have been defined under the 'OBJECTS' and 'LEGEND' sections.

Here's a breakdown of what we need to do:
1. Define the objects correctly.
2. Utilize the 'LEGEND' section to create aliases if needed but do not use it for direct equivalent mapping.
3. Ensure that the declarations are correct, especially for the 'LEGEND' and 'SYMBOLS' used in specifying object characters.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

Title: Simple Sokoban

# LEGEND

P = Player
W = Wall

```

**Changes made:**
- Corrected the use of 'LEGEND' to provide meaningful mappings consistent with PuzzleScript syntax.
- Ensured every element is appropriately defined in its respective sections (OBJECTS and LEGEND).
- Adjusted the WINCONDITION to refer to "Box" instead of "B" for clarity, as per standard usage.

With these revisions, the code should compile without the errors previously reported, and the game should work correctly as intended.
