To generate a complete PuzzleScript game, let's break down the process:

1. **Design Concept:** Choose a simple and clear game concept that can be implemented in PuzzleScript. I will go with a classic Sokoban-like game where the player pushes boxes onto target locations.

2. **Define Game Elements:**
   - Player: The character controlled by the player.
   - Box: An element that can be pushed by the player.
   - Target: The location where boxes need to be placed.
   - Wall: An object that blocks movement.
   - Floor: The default surface where the player can walk.

3. **Define Levels:** Create a few levels of varying difficulty to provide a complete experience.

4. **Write the PuzzleScript Code:** Structure it with objects, rules, and win conditions.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript game for a Sokoban-like puzzle:

### Explanation:

- **Objects:** Defined using colors and symbols. The player, boxes, walls, and targets have simple graphical representations.

- **Legend:** Maps symbols to objects in the game world for easier level design.

- **Win Condition:** All boxes need to be on target locations for the player to win.

- **Rules:** Movement rules specify that players can push boxes, and managing transitions for target states.

- **Collision Layers:** Define how objects interact and render. For instance, walls block players and boxes.

- **Levels:** A series of levels with increasing difficulty to introduce players gradually to the mechanics.

This structure should provide a complete, understandable, and playable Sokoban puzzle game.
