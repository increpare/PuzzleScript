To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that the format adheres to PuzzleScript's syntax rules. Here are some key issues and the proposed fixes:

1. **Objects:**
   - The graphics for each tile (within the `Objects` section) should define a single character or use `this` if extended graphical elements are not needed. Instead of attempting to define graphics with multi-line pixel art, we describe the objects using single-character representations.
   - You can use comments and descriptions for clarification if needed, but don't try to define complex graphics directly within `Objects`. The focus should be on creating a clear and simple character representation.

2. **The Legend Section:**
   - The legend should properly map the objects to single alphabetic or symbolic representations that align with the game logic and levels.

3. **Win Conditions and Rules:**
   - Ensure the win conditions and rules are syntactically correct and consistent with object definitions.

Here's the repaired version of the game code:

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Simplified Object Definitions:** Used a single character to represent each object. Original pixel art definitions are not supported in the `OBJECTS` section.
- **Maintain Simplicity in the Legend:** Established a direct mapping from a single character object to a symbol or character in the levels, essential to define each object.
- **Simplified Rules:** Removed unnecessary rules that directly matched default behaviors or syntax issues, specifically removing `[Target | Box] -> [Target]` and `[Target Box] -> [Target Box]` as these rules may conflict with the objective or cause undefined behavior. Boxes on targets naturally meet the win condition if the collision detection is correctly implemented.
