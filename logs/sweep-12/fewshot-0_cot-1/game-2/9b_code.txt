To address the issue with the game code, let's walk through the errors highlighted by the console output:

1. **Unrecognised syntax in object definitions**: The PuzzleScript language has a specific format to define objects, which seems to have been misunderstood in your original code implementation. The correct definition of objects consists of a name, character, and color, defined as follows:

    ```
    Name Char
    color
    ```

    The player, wall, box, and target objects need to be redefined.

2. **Object Error Definitions**: Removing redundant 'Background' from object definitions in line 4 and adjusting the rest according to the correct format.

3. **Ensure that lines for each object begin correctly with its name and there's no duplication, especially for 'Background'.

Let's fix the code by re-writing the object definitions and ensure they match the correct format:

```plaintext
Title: Simple Sokoban

# OBJECTS
Background
. 
grey

Player
P 
#ff0000

Wall
W 
#000000

Box
B 
#00ff00

Target
T 
#0000ff

# LEGEND
. = Background
P = Player
W = Wall
B = Box
T = Target

# WINCONDITIONS
All Box on Target

# RULES
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player > Box]

# COLLISIONLAYERS

# Level 4

```

The code should now compile correctly, fixing the errors due to improper object definition.
