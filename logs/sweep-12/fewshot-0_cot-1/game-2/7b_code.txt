The errors in the console output suggest that there's a mistake in how objects and aliases were defined using the `LEGEND` directive. The error lines correspond to the object definitions and alias definitions, indicating potentially incorrect definitions or missing configurations.

Here's the plan:
1. **Fix Object Definitions**: The `OBJECTS` section should clearly define individual game elements line by line with clear separation. Currently, it appears a legend-like definition is being used inside the objects section.

2. **Remove Redundant Legend Section**: The `LEGEND` section typically aliases simpler names for combined objects or layers, which isn't necessary when the setup is straightforward without complexity, as here. The provided `LEGEND` section doesn't correctly map to any complex representation.

3. **Reallocate Collision Layers** to correspond clearly to objects without overlap in designation within the game logic.

With the errors identified, here's the corrected PuzzleScript code:

I removed the `LEGEND` section since it was redundant; the simple 1-to-1 mapping of characters to objects suffices for this game setup. Each layer now clearly corresponds to individual game elements under `COLLISIONLAYERS`. This should correct the parsing errors and resolve the compilation issues.
