The error messages indicate that there are unrecognized entries in the prelude of the code, which suggests that there are issues with the object definitions. In PuzzleScript, objects must be defined with a specific syntax, using colors and patterns, rather than color names alone as was attempted in the provided code.

To fix the errors, I will do the following:
1. Correct the object definitions by specifying their appearance with a color and pattern.
2. Ensure each object is defined with a bitmask or specific set of pixels (in a grid) that corresponds to a traditional representation in PuzzleScript.

Let's proceed by correcting the object definitions according to these principles.

In this corrected version, I defined each game element using the "color" label followed by a visualization block, which is five lines each containing five characters (either 0 for background or another digit for elements of the object). This structure should meet the expected input format required by PuzzleScript, and should resolve the prelude errors seen in the original code.
