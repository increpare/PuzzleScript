The error messages indicate that there are issues in the object declaration section of the PuzzleScript code. The main problem is that the formatting for defining objects in PuzzleScript is incorrect. To define objects properly, the syntax should have individual object definitions rather than listing them directly. We also notice that there's no actual code for defining a "Goal," but there's a rule referencing it; we'll address that by fixing the usage. Moreover, there's no proper way to define goals inline, and we'll change the rules to accommodate this.

Here's a revised version of the code:

```plaintext
Title: Box Mover

# =========OBJECTS========
Background
lightgreen

Target
yellow

Box
brown

Player
red

Wall
black

# ========LEGEND==========
.=Background
P=Player
o=Box
T=Target
#=Wall

# =========SOUNDS=========
# Optional: Define game sounds here

# ========COLLISION LAYERS=========
Background
Target, Player, Box
Wall

# =========RULES==========
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[Box | Target] -> [Goal | Target] 

# =========WINCONDITIONS==========
All Boxes on Target

# =========LEVELS=========

# Level 1

#     #
#  .  #
# o   #
#     #
# P   #

# Level 2

#  .o #
#     #
#     #
# P   #

# =========END OF CODE==========
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- The objects are now properly defined, each with a single identifier representing a color.
- Removed `T1` and other redundant identifiers for single-color objects.
- Repeated the definition for the same item removed; each object is unique and only defined by its color and character.
- Adapted the rule to correctly handle when a box is on a target, using a pseudo "Goal" object, which aligns with PuzzleScript's style of marking objectives based on conditions without needing to define a new entity type.
- Updated the win condition to reflect correctly all boxes should be on their respective targets.
