The error messages indicate that there are unrecognized lines in the prelude. In PuzzleScript, the prelude is typically where object definitions start. Hence, these errors suggest that there might be an issue with object definitions, particularly with the way colors and sprites are defined. 

Upon inspecting the 'Objects' section in the code, one main issue is that PuzzleScript does not support custom colors or multi-line ASCII-art sprites directly in the language. Instead, object definitions typically utilize single-letter multi-frame character sequences to illustrate their sprites. 

Therefore, to fix the prelude errors, I will replace the complex color and sprite definitions with simple definitions consistent with PuzzleScript standards. I'll use characters to represent simple objects visually, and adjust the collision layers and rules accordingly if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

```plaintext
Title: Box Mover

# =========OBJECTS========
Background
transparent
.

Target
yellow
T

Box
brown
o

Player
red
P

Wall
black
#

# ========LEGEND==========
.=Background
P=Player
o=Box
T=Target
#=Wall

# =========SOUNDS=========
# Optional: Define game sounds here

# ========COLLISION LAYERS=========
Background
Target, Player, Box
Wall

# =========RULES==========
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[Box | Target] -> [Goal | Target]

# =========WINCONDITIONS==========
All Box on Target

# =========LEVELS=========

# Level 1
#######
#     #
#  T  #
# o   #
#     #
# P   #
#######

# Level 2
#######
#     #
#  To #
#     #
#     #
# P   #
#######

# =========END OF CODE==========

```

This code uses single-character representations for objects: background is '.', player is 'P', box is 'o', target is 'T', and the wall is '#'. These changes should resolve the errors and be compatible with the PuzzleScript engine.
