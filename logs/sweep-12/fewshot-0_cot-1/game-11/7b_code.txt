The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code indicate issues with the object definitions and lack of sprites for those objects. PuzzleScript expects each object definition to be accompanied by a color specification and a sprite using "%%%%%" format for visual representation. Let's correct this by adding appropriate sprite representations for the game objects as needed.

Let's fix these issues and make sure every defined object has the necessary sprite representation.

```

In this repaired code, each object now has a defined sprite using the "%%%%%" format followed by a simple 5x1 or 5x5 pattern to represent each object visually. This should resolve the "Unrecognised stuff" errors related to incomplete object definitions in the prelude.
