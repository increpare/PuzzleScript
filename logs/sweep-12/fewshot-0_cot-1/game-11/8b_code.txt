The errors in the PuzzleScript code are primarily focused on the formatting of the object representations. In PuzzleScript, the definition of an object has several components, including a name, color, visual representation, and optionally a legend character. Each object should be defined using only relevant lines, without excess visual appearance blocks. 

The initial code mistakenly includes sections like `%%%%%` and `.....` which are not appropriate or necessary for object definitions. These lines have caused the "Unrecognised stuff in the prelude" errors. I will remove these extraneous lines from each object definition.

Additionally, the collision layer sections and rest of the logic need checking to ensure validity, but they seem proper in this context.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

```plaintext
Title: Box Mover

# =========OBJECTS========
Background
transparent

Target
yellow
T

Box
brown
o

Player
red
P

Wall
black
#

# =========LEGEND==========
. = Background
P = Player
o = Box
T = Target
# = Wall

# ========COLLISION LAYERS=========
Background
Target
Player
Box
Wall

# =========RULES==========
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[Box | Target] -> [Background | Target]

# =========WINCONDITIONS==========
All Box on Target

# =========LEVELS=========

# Level 1
#######
#     #
#  T  #
# o   #
#     #
# P   #
#######

# Level 2
#######
#     #
#  To #
#     #
#     #
# P   #
#######
```

All extraneous lines related to object definitions have been removed to fix the errors. The object definitions now only include a name, color, and a single visual character line as intended by PuzzleScript syntax.
