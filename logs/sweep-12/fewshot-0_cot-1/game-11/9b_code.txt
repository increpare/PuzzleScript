To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that each section of the code follows the proper syntax for PuzzleScript games. The errors arise from incorrectly formatted object definitions and possibly an incorrect structure in the collision layers or other sections.

Upon reviewing the provided code, I notice that the object definitions in the game use a format that isn't correct in PuzzleScript. Let's correct the syntax in the object definitions to ensure they're using the correct format. Also, the collision layers should be properly organized. The code will be fixed based on PuzzleScript's syntax expectations:

1. **Object Definitions**: Each object should be defined by the `ObjectName color` format, and associated sprite designations or attributes should be done using `COLOR` and sprite characters.

2. **Legend**: The legend links symbols to objects correctly. 

3. **Collision Layers**: These are done in sequence. The game does use separate lines correctly here.

Here is the repaired version of the code:

```plaintext
Title: Box Mover

# =========OBJECTS========
Background
COLOR transparent

Target
COLOR yellow
T

Box
COLOR brown
o

Player
COLOR red
P

Wall
COLOR black
#

# =========LEGEND==========
. = Background
P = Player
o = Box
T = Target
# = Wall

# ========COLLISION LAYERS=========
Background
Target
Player
Box
Wall

# =========RULES==========
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[Box | Target] -> [Background | Target]

# =========WINCONDITIONS==========
All Box on Target

# =========LEVELS=========

# Level 1
#######
#     #
#  T  #
# o   #
#     #
# P   #
#######

# Level 2
#######
#     #
#  To #
#     #
#     #
# P   #
#######
```

Key changes include making sure each object starts with its name and the word `COLOR` to denote the attribute for color before specifying the color itself. This is vital for the PuzzleScript engine to parse the objects correctly. With these corrections, the code should compile correctly.
