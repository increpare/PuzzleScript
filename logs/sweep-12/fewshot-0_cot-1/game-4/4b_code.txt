The errors in the PuzzleScript code arise from incorrect use of the language syntax and a few structural issues. Let's go through them step by step and correct them:

1. **Prelude Issues**: The prelude section should only have `[title]` at the beginning. However, `[legend]`, `[collisionlayers]`, `[rules]`, `[winconditions]`, and everything else that defines the game should come after setting up the title. The error messages indicate there's unrecognized content which usually results from improper structuring or syntax errors.

2. **Fixing Errors in Syntax**:
   - The word "Crate" is used in the rules but is not defined in the legend. It is likely a mishap and should be corrected to "Box".
   - Some additional object collisions need extra handling, specifically regarding the new states like `PlayerOnGoal` which aren't properly utilized in the rule set.

3. **Refinement**: 
   - Ensure "PlayerOnGoal" and "BoxOnGoal" are properly handled within the game logic. If theyâ€™re used as composite states, we should make sure rules reflect transitions between these states.

4. **Collision Layers Configuration**: This needs to be consistent with how the objects interact.

Let's correct the code:

```plaintext
[title]
Simple Sokoban

[legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal
PlayerOnGoal = Player G
BoxOnGoal = Box G

[collisionlayers]
Background
Wall
Goal
Player, Box

[rules]
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | G ] -> [ PlayerOnGoal ]
[ Box | G ] -> [ BoxOnGoal ]
[ PlayerOnGoal | G ] -> [ Player | G ]
[ BoxOnGoal | G ] -> [ Box | G ]

[winconditions]
All BoxOnGoal

[levels]
#####
#...#
#.#.#
#PB #
#####
```

**Explanations for the fixes:**
- Corrected the rule to use `Box` instead of `Crate`.
- Updated the legend to align the naming between the rules and the legend.
- Added handling of returning from "PlayerOnGoal" and "BoxOnGoal" to "Player" and "Box", in case they move off a "Goal" tile.
- Kept consistent naming throughout the definitions and handling sections.
