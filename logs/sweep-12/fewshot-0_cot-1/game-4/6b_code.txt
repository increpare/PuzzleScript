It looks like the current code for the PuzzleScript game declares an incorrect structure in the [Legend] section. The errors indicate that the script is misinterpreting the legend symbols, possibly due to not defining the objects first before using them in combinations like `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal`.

To resolve this, we should start by defining individual objects and layers correctly before creating combinations. The order and use of the [Legend] section must match how objects are intended to be used. Let's address these errors by clearly defining each object symbol and use checks only for items directly associated with game entities.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```plaintext
[Title]
Simple Sokoban

[Objects]
Background . 
Wall #
Player P
Box B
Goal G
PlayerOnGoal P G
BoxOnGoal B G

[Legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal
PG = PlayerOnGoal
BG = BoxOnGoal

[CollisionLayers]
Background
Wall
Goal
Player, Box

[Rules]
[> Player | Box] -> [> Player | > Box]
[ Player | G ] -> [ PlayerOnGoal ]
[ Box | G ] -> [ BoxOnGoal ]
[ PlayerOnGoal | G ] -> [ Player | G ]
[ BoxOnGoal | G ] -> [ Box | G ]

[WinConditions]
All BoxOnGoal

[Levels]

```

### Adjustments Made:
1. **Declare Objects:** We correctly declared each object in the `[Objects]` section with their symbols.
2. **Legend Clarification:** Moved composite objects `PlayerOnGoal` and `BoxOnGoal` to the `[Objects]` definition first, then associated them with single-character identifiers in the `[Legend]`.
3. This ensures consistency and clarifies the entity representation in the `[Legend]`.

These changes should prevent the compilation errors previously encountered.
