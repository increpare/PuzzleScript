The errors in the original code indicate that the game description is not starting with the correct Syntax sections in the PuzzleScript language. According to the PuzzleScript syntax, the game description should include mandatory sections like `title`, `legend`, `collisionlayers`, `rules`, `winconditions`, and `levels`.  
The move rule for moving "Player" and "Box" also needs to be adjusted in form.
Let's restructure the game code with these considerations in mind.

```plaintext
[title]
Simple Sokoban

[legend]
. = Background
# = Wall
P = Player
B = Box
G = Goal

PlayerOnGoal = Player Goal
BoxOnGoal = Box Goal

[collisionlayers]
Background
Wall
Goal
Player, Box

[rules]
[> Player | Crate ] -> [> Player | > Crate ]
[ Player | Goal ] -> [ PlayerOnGoal ]
[ Box | Goal ] -> [ BoxOnGoal ]

[winconditions]
All BoxOnGoal

[levels]
#####
#...#
#.#.#
#PB #
#####
```

Here's the breakdown:
1. **Title**: Added a `title` section to define the name of the game.
2. **Legend**: Defined in lowercase (`legend`).
3. **CollisionLayers**: Adjusted the order of layers based on typical conventions for clarity.
4. **Rules**: Ensured the use of the `>` and the `Crate` keyword as a placeholder to fix syntax issues.  
5. **WinConditions**: Properly formatted win conditions and removed brackets not needed around `BoxOnGoal`.
6. **Levels**: This section remained unchanged as the level structure itself was already correct.
