To resolve the compilation errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, I'll follow these steps:

1. Verify the object definitions: Each object should correctly define its name, color, and art. The errors suggest that the expected format for object definitions isn't being followed. Based on PuzzleScript's typical syntax, the structure should include labels like `object XYZ` and `color` for clarity.

2. Check the rules logic: Verify that rule syntax is consistent with PuzzleScript conventions, where shorthand notations for objects in rules (`Key K`) are typically used correctly in a context where these pairs make sense within the game logic.

3. Review the legend section: Ensure that object references in the legend are valid and correspond to the defined objects.

4. Inspect the win conditions and levels: Verify no syntactical errors interrupt the intended logic or object references.

Let's address these changes and present the corrected code block:

Key changes made:

- Added the `color` keyword for each object to indicate the color definitively, aligning with typical PuzzleScript specifications for such formats.
- Corrected the syntax in the rules appropriately to reflect proper PuzzleScript formatting.
- Maintained the existing game design while ensuring all objects, rules, and levels are syntactically valid.
