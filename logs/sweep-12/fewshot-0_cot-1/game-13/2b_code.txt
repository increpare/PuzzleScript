The errors in the given PuzzleScript game code are occurring because the `#objects` section should only define the graphical and color properties of the objects. Definitions for what each symbol represents should reside in the `#legend` section, not the `#objects` section. Attributes such as movement, sounds, or interaction rules aren't part of the `#objects` or `#legend` section but are defined in rules and other relevant sections.

To resolve the mentioned errors, the initial mistake involves the misplacement of object descriptions in the `#objects` section. In this particular case, we need the game object descriptions to be focused solely on the visual representation or colors if needed. The functionality and relationships are already correctly handled via the `#legend` and `#rules` sections.

I will now simplify the `#objects` section while ensuring the necessary components are correctly structured in the rest of the code. Let's fix the provided code accordingly:

```plaintext
#objects
Background
Player
Wall
Key
Door
Goal

#legend
. = Background
P = Player
W = Wall
K = Key
D = Door
G = Goal

#sounds
SFX1 WIN
SFX2 CANCEL
SFX3 UNDO
SFX4 PUSH
SFX5 MOVE
SFX6 CREATE

#rules
[Player | Key] -> [Player | ]  SFX6
[Key | Player] -> [ | Player]  SFX6
[Player | Door with Key and Goal] -> [Player | Goal]  SFX1
[Player | Door with Key] -> [Player | Background]  SFX5
[Player | Door] -> [Player | Door]  SFX2 
[Player] -> [Background]

#winconditions
All Goals

#levels
; Player must collect the key to open the door and reach the goal
########
#......#
#.PKD..#
#..GW..#
#......#
########

; A slightly more challenging level with multiple keys and doors
########
#......#
#..P...#
#.K.WK.#
#..WDW.#
#.G....#
#......#
########

; Introduce a maze-like level with keys and doors
#############
#...........#
#..P.W.K....#
#..WWWWW....#
#..K.D.K.W..#
#.WW.WD.W..G#
#...........#
#############
```

In this revised code, I've modified the `#objects` section to only list the object names without extra symbols. This should resolve the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
