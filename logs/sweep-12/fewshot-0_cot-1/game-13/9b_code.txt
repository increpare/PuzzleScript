The console output indicates that there are issues in the prelude of the original code, specifically with object definitions. The errors occur because the format for object definitions in the original code is incorrect. The PuzzleScript language doesn't use a format like `[ObjectName] [Color] [PixelArt]`. Instead, it uses a more straightforward object definition syntax, where properties like `color` and pixel art are specified inline. I'll correct these errors by conforming to the correct syntax for object definitions in PuzzleScript.

Here's the repaired code:

Explanation:
- Object definitions now use the correct syntax by denoting `color` immediately after the object name.
- Removed the incorrect object definition syntax that mixed object names with colors and pixel art in the heading style.
- The rest of the code maintains the original logic for collisions, rules, and levels, aiming to keep the game's intent intact.
