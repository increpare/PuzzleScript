The errors suggest that the initial lines in the code are not recognized as valid PuzzleScript syntax. In PuzzleScript, the object definitions start with the keyword "OBJECT", and the prelude expected by the parser doesn't match the definitions given.

To fix this, we need to follow the correct syntax for defining objects. We should also revise any inappropriate rule syntax and ensure there is a valid prelude format. Here's how you can define a PuzzleScript game correctly with the provided scenario.

### Explanation

- **Title**: Added the title for the game.
- **Objects Definition**: Removed any additional text that was causing confusion and formatted it according to PuzzleScript object syntax.
- **Legend**: Maintained as-is; it helps map characters onto object names for the level design.
- **Rules**: Adjusted appropriately; for example, ensured that the movement rules were correct with the key and door interactions.
- **Win Conditions**: Ensure the correct win condition syntax, filtering when the Player reaches the Goal.
- **Levels**: No change needed here unless the shapes were incorrect; levels seem well-structured.

This code should now compile correctly without prelude and syntax errors related to object definitions.
