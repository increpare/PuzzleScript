The provided PuzzleScript code contains errors in the formatting and layout, which are causing compilation issues. The errors primarily revolve around the incorrect use of PuzzleScript components. Based on the output, it appears the issues are related to the "objects" and "legend" sections, which aren't formatted properly.

Here's what we'll need to address:

1. **#objects section**: It looks like the provided objects are not correctly defined with colors and visuals, as expected in a typical PuzzleScript "objects" section.
2. **#legend section**: Ensure that symbols and object mappings are properly defined.
3. **#rules section**: Needs revision for correct syntax, particularly in conditions like "Door with Key and Goal".

Here is the repaired code:

**Adjustments made:**
- Added colors and visuals in the `#objects` section. Each object is associated with a color and an ASCII character.
- Fixed the rules to follow the correct syntax. Removed "Door with Key and Goal" as it's not supported directly in the rule syntax.
- The introductory logic indicating an action when interacting with doors or keys is now syntactically correct.
- Removed the implicit clearing of players; replaced it with proper gameplay actions where necessary.

These changes should make the script compile properly and ensure the game functions as expected.
