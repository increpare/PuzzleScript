The current issue with the provided PuzzleScript game code is that the object definitions are formatted incorrectly. In the PuzzleScript language, object definitions should adhere to specific expected structures. The list of sounds is redundant, and since PuzzleScript uses implicit sound effects, they should be removed.

I will correct these aspects by specifying the objects with images included in subscripting text style format. I'll then clean up the incorrect sections, reintroduce the correct syntax for defining objects, and remove explicitly mentioned sounds as they don't have explicit specification capabilities in the core syntax of PuzzleScript.

Here's how the corrected version of the code would look:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation
- Each object needs a visual representation. In this case, I used a simple visual pattern suggesting their nature using binary-like grid art.
- Removed the erroneous sound effect specifications since they don't adhere to standard PuzzleScript syntax and are not required for specifying game logic.
- Kept the rules format, win conditions, and levels intact as they logically describe the game's mechanics.
