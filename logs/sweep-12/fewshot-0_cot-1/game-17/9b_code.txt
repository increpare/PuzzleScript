The error message indicates that the symbol " " (space) is used in the LEVELS section but is not defined in the LEGEND section. In PuzzleScript, any character used to represent an object in the level maps must be defined in the LEGEND section so the engine knows what object it's meant to represent.

Currently, there is no definition for a space (" ") in the LEGEND. The intended object for empty spaces is likely the "Background", which is currently mapped to a period (".").

To fix this error, we can map the space " " to the "Background" in the LEGEND section. This change will ensure the game understands that blank spaces in the level are meant to represent the Background.

Here is the revised code with the error fixed:

```

This change substitutes the intended empty spaces with the correct representation defined in the LEGEND, addressing the error and allowing the game to compile correctly.
