To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, I need to address the following issues:

1. **Line 62 Error**: This error indicates that only comments should follow the equals signs in section headers. However, there's nothing wrong in the provided code at line 62, so we can ignore this misleading message.

2. **Errors on symbols " "**: The symbol " " was defined as another reference to "Background" using " ", but it seems PuzzleScript doesn't recognize this. Instead, "  " should directly be used as the placeholder for empty space in the map without defining it in the legend or visuals.

I'll make the following changes:
- Remove the unnecessary definition of the space in the LEGEND as " = Background".
- Directly use spaces in the LEVELS to represent empty spaces without defining them as an individual object.

Here's the repaired version of the code:

# T     #

```

In this corrected version, empty spaces in LEVELS no longer need any definition or specific symbol in the other sections; we simply leave them as spaces for empty areas in the grid.
