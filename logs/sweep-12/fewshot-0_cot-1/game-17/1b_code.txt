The errors are related to the specification of the sprites in the OBJECTS section. Each sprite uses numbers to refer to colors defined for that object. These numbers start at 0 and should match the sequence of colors defined for the sprite.

In your code, the Box, Target, and BoxOnTarget sprites appear to have color indexing errors. Let's address the sprite color issues:

1. **Box Sprite**:
   - The Box sprite only has one color defined (Brown), but attempts to use color index '1' in its design. This should be corrected to use index '0'.

2. **Target Sprite**:
   - The Target sprite only has one color defined (Red), but the design uses index '2'. This should be corrected to use index '0'.

3. **BoxOnTarget Sprite**:
   - The BoxOnTarget sprite should reference colors for Box and Target. Both are defined separately, but you should adjust indices according to a combined palette if needed or separate correctly based on the ruleset. It typically requires referencing an existing object or ensuring the index is 0 if both are not combined.

I will correct these issues and provide the full corrected code below:

In the correction:
- The Box object's sprite now uses `0` instead of `1`.
- The Target object's sprite uses `0`.
- The BoxOnTarget object uses a composite palette to correct indexing.
