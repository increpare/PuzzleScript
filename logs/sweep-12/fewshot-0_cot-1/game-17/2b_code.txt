To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address several key errors:

1. **Sprite Size Error**: All sprite graphics must be 5x5, but the ones provided are 3x3. We need to redesign these sprites to be 5x5.

2. **Symbol Error**: The space character " " used as a placeholder in the rules and levels does not have a corresponding definition in the LEGEND section. We can define an IGNORE or placeholder object to use instead.

3. **Rule Length Error**: The rules need to have matching patterns on both sides of the '->' operator. We'll ensure the length of patterns under 'RULES' are consistent on both sides.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

Explanation:

- I increased the size of all sprite definitions to 5x5.
- Defined an underscore (`_`) as a placeholder for the Background in the LEGEND to replace the space error.
- Adjusted the rules to ensure the patterns on both sides of the rules match in length; especially corrected the rules where `Player` and `Box` interaction length didn't match.
- Replaced spaces (` `) in LEVELS with underscores (`_`) to use the defined background character. 

These changes should fix the compilation errors and make the game work correctly.
