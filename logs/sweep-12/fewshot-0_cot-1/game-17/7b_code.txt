The error in this PuzzleScript code arises due to the use of the " " (space) character in the LEVELS section, which hasn't been defined in the LEGEND section. Every character used to represent an object in the level maps must be defined in the LEGEND.

To fix this, we need to define an empty space symbol, such as "E", for "Empty" or a similar descriptor. We can map this symbol to the Background object in the LEGEND section and then replace all spaces in the LEVELS section with this new symbol.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

Changes made:
- Added `E = Background` in the LEGEND section to define a symbol for empty spaces.
- Replaced all space characters in the LEVELS section with the new symbol "E". 

Now the game code should compile and run without errors.
