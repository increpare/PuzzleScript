To create a PuzzleScript game, we need to ensure we have all the necessary components: 

1. **Objects:** Define the visual elements or sprites that players will see and interact with in the game. We'll usually want a player character, goals, walls, and any other interactive or decorative elements.

2. **Legend:** Link object names to their sprites, allowing you to reference them easily.

3. **Sounds (optional):** Define any sounds associated with game actions.

4. **Collision Layers:** Specify which objects can overlap or interact with each other.

5. **Rules:** Define the logic and behavior for how objects interact. This typically includes movement rules and any conditions for game-winning or object interaction.

6. **Win Conditions:** Specify what conditions must be met for the player to win the level.

7. **Levels:** Create at least one level layout, using a grid of the previously defined objects.

8. **Prelude and Metadata (optional):** Any additional game information or credits.

For this example, Iâ€™ll design a simple Sokoban-like game. The player needs to push boxes onto targets to win.

### Explanation:
- **Objects:** We've defined a `Player`, `Wall`, `Box`, `Target`, and a combination `BoxOnTarget` to simplify rule management when a box is already on a target.
- **Legend:** Assigns characters for level layouts.
- **Collision Layers:** Specifies interactions; the player can't overlap with walls or boxes.
- **Rules:** Manage the player pushing boxes, and how targets are affected.
- **Win Conditions:** The game is won when all boxes are on targets.
- **Levels:** A few sample layouts are provided, with walls surrounding the play area.

This setup should cover a beginner-friendly introduction to a Sokoban-style puzzle game using PuzzleScript.
