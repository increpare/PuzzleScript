To repair the errors found in the PuzzleScript game code, we must address the following issues:

1. **Space Issue in Levels**: The console output indicates that the symbol `" "` (space) is used in the map but not defined in the LEGEND. This typically results from typing spaces instead of periods for the Background. We should replace spaces with a defined symbol, usually the period `"."` for the Background.

2. **Pattern Length Mismatch in Rules**: The errors in lines 82 and 83 suggest that there is a mismatch in the pattern lengths between the left and right side of the rules. Specifically, we need to have the same number of cells on both the left and right sides of the rule.

Let's fix these issues by:
- Replacing all spaces in the LEVELS section with `"."`.
- Adjusting the RULES section so each rule has patterns of equal length on both sides.

Here's the corrected code:

```

**Explanation**:
- Replaced spaces in LEVELS with dots, aligning them with the defined Background.
- Adjusted the RULES so that left and right sides are of equal length: `[Player | Target] -> [Player | Target]` and `[Box | Target] -> [BoxOnTarget | Target]`. This ensures precise matches on both sides of the transformation.
