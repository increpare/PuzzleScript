The PuzzleScript error messages indicate several issues in the provided code:

1. **Legend Section Syntax Error:** The legend section must define each game object representation on a new line with a single equals sign. 

2. **Missing Sounds Section:** The Sounds section is required even if it is empty, according to error messages. All section headings must be included in the correct order.

3. **Incorrect Rule Names:** The rules contain comment indications considered as unknown object names, which the system fails to recognize. Comments should start with a `#`.

4. **Capitalization Error:** The error mentions unknown object names because they do not match exactly with those defined in the OBJECTS section. The game logic expects exact syntax.

Here's the corrected version of the code.

### Key Corrections:

1. **Legend Formatting:** Each object definition now uses correct syntax with spaces around the equals sign.

2. **Sounds Section Added:** Included an empty Sounds section to maintain required ordering.

3. **Object Name Matching:** Rules use the correct object identifiers exactly as defined (e.g., `Player` as `P`, `Box` as `B`, etc.).

4. **Correct Commenting in Rules:** Ensured in-line comments for rules are preceded by a `#` to avoid misinterpretation as object names.
