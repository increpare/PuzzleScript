Let's analyze the errors and devise a plan to correct them:

1. **Line 47: Sound Event Expected** - This error indicates that there's an expectation for a specific sound event. However, you have left the "SOUNDS" section intentionally blank. Since it's optional, you can either keep it empty or add something minimal if needed. 

2. **Line 63 onward: Objects outside square brackets and non-existent names** - The rules have some syntax issues. In the original rules provided, some structures were not correctly utilizing the direction symbols (`RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `UP`, `DOWN`), and there were inaccuracies with what's acceptable inside the rules' brackets. This should be fixed by using correct PuzzleScript directional formatting and syntax.

After understanding these issues, here's the revised code:
