Based on the error messages provided, it seems there are some mix-ups in the syntax and possibly missing definitions or incorrect references in the PuzzleScript code.

- The error on line 48 suggests that an invalid entry is expected where typically sound events or object names should be defined. It's possible that a misplacement or a misinterpretation of sections happened in the "SOUNDS" block.
  
- Errors on lines 64, 70, and 76 indicate that names referred to in rules are not defined, suggesting issues with how rules are constructed or named. In PuzzleScript, rules are strictly defined with object names or directions, not arbitrary identifiers like "movement," "pushing," and "updating."

A solution is to correct these issues:

1. Remove any mistakenly added lines or characters that are causing issues.
2. Ensure that all rule lines only use objects, directions, or explicit conditions.
3. Maintain simplicity and avoid using names that aren't defined in the code.

Here's the corrected version of the game script:
