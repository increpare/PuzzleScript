To address the errors detected in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to ensure that each section follows the correct format and order according to the PuzzleScript standards. Let's assess the specific issues:

1. **Legend Declarations**: The code uses shorthand representations (`#`, `P`, `B`, etc.) in the legend section, but it should use the format `"Symbol = Object"`. This requires us to define each shorthand in terms of the objects.

2. **Order of Sections**: Make sure all sections are in the correct order. Particularly, the `SOUNDS` section needs to be present even if it is empty.

3. **Collision Layer Specification**: Ensure that all objects used in collision layers and rules are properly defined in the legend.

4. **Rules Section**: Verify that the objects and shorthand used in the rules have been defined in the legend.

By addressing these issues, we should be able to fix the provided game code. Here is the corrected version of the code:

Adjustments made include correcting the legend definitions to comply with PuzzleScript's requirement that legend symbols be defined distinctly and inline with their corresponding objects. The `SOUNDS` section is included even though it's empty, adhering to the order rules expected by the compiler. All symbols utilized in rules and levels are verified to ensure they're defined in the legend, addressing any discrepancies.
