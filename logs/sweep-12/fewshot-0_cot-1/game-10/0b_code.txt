To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define a simple yet engaging puzzle game. A classic and easy introduction to PuzzleScript games includes elements like walls, player, targets, and boxes to push. A common game type that fits this description is "Sokoban."

### Game Components:
1. **Objects**: We'll need to define walls, a player, targets, and boxes.
2. **Legend**: We'll map symbols to objects for easy level design.
3. **Sounds**: Decide whether to include simple sound effects or leave it silent.
4. **Collision Rules**: These will manage interactions between objects.
5. **Win Conditions**: The game should be won when all boxes are on targets.
6. **Levels**: We'll create a small set of levels to demonstrate gameplay.

### Plan:
1. Start by defining the necessary objects like walls, players, boxes, and targets.
2. Map these objects to symbols using a legend.
3. Write rules for movement and interactions, such as pushing boxes.
4. Define the win condition, where all boxes must be on targets.
5. Create a few levels to play through.

Below is a complete PuzzleScript game code for a simple Sokoban-like game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined basic game pieces including Wall, Player, Box, and Target.
- **Legend**: Provides an easy mapping for designing levels.
- **Rules**: Describe how players can move and push boxes and how states change.
- **Win Conditions**: The game ends successfully when all boxes are on targets.
- **Levels**: Three simple levels to start with, showcasing different arrangements. 

This setup uses basic PuzzleScript capabilities to create a functioning, albeit simple, Sokoban game. Adding more levels or increasing complexity in rules or interactions could enhance the game further.
