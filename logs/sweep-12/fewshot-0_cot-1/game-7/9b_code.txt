The error messages indicate that there are issues with the color definitions in the `objects` section of the code. Each object should be given a unique name and associated with a distinct RGB color value. However, it seems that the object names are being interpreted incorrectly due to a lack of distinct lines or spaces. Additionally, the error messages suggest that the numeric values are being interpreted as names, which indicates a problem with the format of the colors.

To fix the code, I will assign unique names to each object and ensure proper syntax for their color definitions.

Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code:

### Changes Made:
1. Added unique shorthand letters for each object in the `objects` block.
2. Ensured correct syntax for objects definition, associating each object with a distinct RGB color.
3. Corrected the legend to match the new shorthand letters used in the objects definition.

This should resolve the compilation errors related to color definitions and allow the game to run correctly.
