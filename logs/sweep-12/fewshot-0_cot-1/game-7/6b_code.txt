The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code arise mainly due to the usage of numerical values for both the object names and colors, which causes confusion in the parser. The legend section is supposed to link object symbols to their respective object definitions, but here too many numerical overlaps are causing parsing issues.

To fix these errors, we can follow these steps:
1. Make sure object names are distinct identifiers and aren't numerical values or parts of RGB color codes.
2. Correct the legend to ensure symbols are correctly mapped to their respective objects.
3. Ensure the syntax follows a correct object definition format, avoiding syntax mistakes related to colors or object names. The capitalization should be consistent in the objects' section since the code refers to these names exactly as declared.

By addressing these issues, the program should compile and run without errors. Here's the corrected version of the game:

Key changes include ensuring consistency in case-sensitive areas and removing the numerical overlaps in object names and color assignments. The code now should compile without the errors reported.
