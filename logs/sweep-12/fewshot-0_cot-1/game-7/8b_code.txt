The errors in the given PuzzleScript game code relate to the way colors are assigned to the objects. Each color component must be a single number, not a sequence on the same line, and they should be separated by the object name and then the RGB values spaced out. Let's correct these errors by ensuring the syntax matches the expected format for PuzzleScript. We'll modify the object declarations to correctly separate the object names and their color codes.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

### Explanation:

1. **Objects Definition:** The primary error was in the object definitions where the RGB values were unintentionally mingled with the object names. This was corrected by separating the names and values according to the expected format.

2. **Colors:** The syntax was corrected so that each object is properly followed by its corresponding RGB values. Ensure that values are separated by spaces to meet the format PuzzleScript accepts.

These changes should allow the script to compile without errors.
