The errors reported in the console output indicate issues with the object definitions related to color specification. In PuzzleScript, each object needs a unique name and a single color specified using RGB values. The line numbers provided in the console output suggest that there is a misunderstanding in the format used for defining colors for the objects.

To fix these errors, we need to ensure that each object has a unique name with its corresponding RGB color correctly specified. Let's address the errors systematically:

1. In the `objects` section:
    - The colors should be specified correctly for each defined object according to the proper syntax: `ObjectName R G B`.
    - Ensure that there are no repeated color names or syntax errors.
    
2. Ensure the `sounds` and `rules` don't utilize any identifier inappropriately tied to colors.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

The key changes include ensuring the syntax for defining colors in the `objects` section is correct and consistent with PuzzleScript's format. This should resolve the compilation errors related to object color definitions.
