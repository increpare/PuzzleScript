The error messages indicate that there are issues in the objects section concerning duplicate color values. In PuzzleScript, each object must have a unique name, and each name should not be an integer as could be confused with color values.

In this case, the issue is that the object names (like "background", "wall", etc.) are being interpreted as color values. This likely happens because there is confusion regarding formatting. We need to ensure that object definitions have the correct syntax, which includes the name, followed by its color components (RGB values).

To resolve these errors, I will ensure each object is correctly defined with its name and color values properly structured. I will also confirm that no name is being misread as a number and correct any misalignment in the structure. Additionally, I'll ensure there are no duplicate color values that are identified with names, thus reordering and commenting the code properly for clarity.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

I added symbols next to the object names to link them to the legend, ensuring there is no confusion about which symbols represent each object in the "objects" section. This way, the code aligns correctly with the syntax expected by PuzzleScript.
