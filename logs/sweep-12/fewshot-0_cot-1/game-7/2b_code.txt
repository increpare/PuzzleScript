The reported errors in the PuzzleScript game code primarily originate from a misunderstanding of the syntax specifics in the PuzzleScript language. The issues identified include:

1. Missing color definitions for objects in the `objects` section.
2. Miscommunication in the `legend` section for objects that are not defined.
3. Incorrect syntax for the sound section; it should refer to movement directions and events.
4. Incorrect handling of sound commands in the `sounds` section, which aren't structured properly.

To resolve these issues, we need to:
- Define colors for the objects in the `objects` section.
- Ensure all elements used in the `legend` are adequately defined in the `objects`.
- Correct syntax errors in the `sounds` section to match a recognized structure within PuzzleScript.
- Ensure that the `rules` section is structured properly and consistently with PuzzleScript conventions.

Here is the revised version of the code:

**Notes on Changes:**
- I've defined colors for each object.
- I've correctly defined categories for the sound section: used `up`, `left`, `right`, and `down` with movement, correctly defining sound events and assigning `sfx` sounds, since PuzzleScript does not support custom sound uploads. 
- Ensured rules are properly formatted with the correct use of syntax in collision definitions and for pushing boxes.
