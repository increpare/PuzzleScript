The error messages suggest that there is an issue with the color definitions of `Wall`, `Target`, and `BoxOnTarget` objects. Specifically, the errors mention that these objects are trying to access colors that are not defined. In the PuzzleScript language, each pixel in an object is represented by a color in the order they are defined per object. If an object has only one color defined (marked by a single character in the defined pattern, like `1`), and it tries to reference a different color code in the pattern, it will cause an error.

To fix these errors, we need to ensure that the pattern for these objects use only the defined colors. Here are the steps to resolve the issues:

1. Ensure each object only uses a single defined color in its representation.
2. Correct the pattern definitions where color reference errors occur.

Letâ€™s correct the object definitions.

In this corrected version:
- The `Wall` object uses `X` consistently for its pattern since it is the single defined color for the `Wall`.
- The `Target` and `BoxOnTarget` have been changed to use `2` and `3` respectively for their interior colors to provide clearer distinction for the layering. The pattern now matches a each defined single color usage ensuring no undefined color access occurs.
