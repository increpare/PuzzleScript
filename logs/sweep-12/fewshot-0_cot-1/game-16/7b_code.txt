To address the errors reported by the compiler, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Sound Event Error:** Line 70 mentions a missing sound event or object name. This occurs because there is an incomplete or incorrect sound block, which in this case is completely empty. If no sounds are needed, the SOUNDS section can be completely removed, or it should be filled with appropriate sound definitions.

2. **Layer Assignment:** Line 48 indicates that the "BoxOnTarget" object is defined but not part of any collision layer. We need to assign this object to a layer to fix the issue.

3. **Map Shape Error:** Lines 114 and 115 show that the levels are not rectangular. Each line within a level must have the same number of symbols. We will ensure each level has the same width by padding shorter lines with objects such as walls `#` or backgrounds `.` to make them rectangular.

Here is the repaired version of the code:

Changes made:
- Removed the empty SOUNDS section to eliminate the sound-related error.
- Added `BoxOnTarget` to the separate layer in COLLISIONLAYERS.
- Adjusted the level designs to make all rows in each level the same length, ensuring they are rectangular. A dot `.` was added to the end of the second level row to standardize row length.
