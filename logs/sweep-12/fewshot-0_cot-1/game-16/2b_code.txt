The initial error messages indicate that there are issues with the color palette and representation of the "Wall" object. In the PuzzleScript language, the color of an object is specified by a single named color (e.g., "Black", "Yellow") from the CSS color list, not by numbers or characters such as "0". 

We'll fix these issues by assigning appropriate color names to the "Wall", "Box", and "BoxOnTarget" objects, correcting any misassumptions or misconfigurations in the object layer, and ensuring each object's sprite is valid. In the Wall object, each "0" should be replaced by a valid CSS color name, such as "Black" for the background and "Gray" for the wall itself. 

Here's the corrected code:

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Wall Object**: Changed '0' to '.' and '1' to a numeric sprite character ('1') to define a simple sprite pattern that can represent the wall using 'Gray' color.

2. **BoxOnTarget Object**: Removed the extra row of '1111' since the sprite should be a 4x4 grid as per the other definitions for consistency.

These changes should fix the compile-time errors while keeping the intended design of the game intact.
