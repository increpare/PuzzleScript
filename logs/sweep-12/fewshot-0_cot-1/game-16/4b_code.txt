To repair the given PuzzleScript code, I'll address the compilation errors one by one as follows:

1. **Wall Object Errors:** The Wall object is defined with a 5x5 matrix, but it contains extra characters 'X' outside the specified matrix. I'll correct the matrix size to align with its defined color.

2. **Sprite Matrix Size Errors:** Ensure every sprite matrix is exactly 5x5, as required by the PuzzleScript language. Adjust any sprite matrices that deviate from this size.

3. **Color Palette Errors:** Ensure the colors used in the matrices are defined correctly. For both the Target and BoxOnTarget objects, ensure the numbers match what's defined in their color palettes.

Let's update the code accordingly:

### Key Corrections

- **Wall:** Adjusted the `Wall` sprite to remove excess 'X' characters.
- **Target and BoxOnTarget:** Adjusted their sprites to ensure they fit within a 5x5 matrix and used numbers matching their color palettes.
- **Player and Box:** Fixed their sizes to ensure they are also 5x5 matrices.

This corrected version should now compile and run as expected without the prior errors.
