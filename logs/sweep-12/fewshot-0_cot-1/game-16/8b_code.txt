To address the issues in the code, I'll take the following steps:

1. **Fix the Section Order**: The PuzzleScript syntax requires the sections to follow a certain order. The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section should come after the `SOUNDS` section. Since `SOUNDS` is missing, I'll add an empty `SOUNDS` section before `COLLISIONLAYERS`.

2. **Correct Object Names in Rules**: The error messages indicate there are rules referencing object names with lower-case 'player' and 'box', whereas they are defined with capital letters ('Player' and 'Box'). I'll update the rules to match the proper case-sensitive names.

Here is the repaired code:

I've added a `SOUNDS` section to keep the section order correct and updated the rules to use the correct case-sensitive names for `Player` and `Box`. This should resolve the issues and allow the game to compile and run as intended.
