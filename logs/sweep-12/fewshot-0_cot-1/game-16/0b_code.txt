To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several key components: the title and author information, legend for sprites, sound settings, collision layers, win conditions, and levels. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Title and Metadata**: Start by providing the title and author details for the game.
2. **Legend**: Define the visual representation of the game elements using characters and colors, which include player, walls, and target objects.
3. **Sounds**: Optionally add sound settings if needed.
4. **Collision Layers**: Define the collision layers to control which objects can overlap or block each other.
5. **Rules**: Define what actions or transformations happen in the game for each key press.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define what conditions must be met for the player to win the game.
7. **Levels**: Design and define individual puzzle levels where these elements interact.

Let's say the game we're designing is a simple box-pushing puzzle (Sokoban-style) where the player has to move all boxes onto target squares. Below is a complete example code for such a game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defines each game element with a visual pattern. We've included the player, walls, boxes, targets, and the 'box on target' state.
- **Legend**: Maps symbols to their respective objects, simplifying level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Controls which objects can occupy the same space.
- **Rules**: Govern the interaction, mainly the movement mechanics appropriate for a box-pushing game.
- **Win Conditions**: The player wins when all boxes are on target squares.
- **Levels**: Define a few levels using the defined legend symbols, keeping levels simple for demonstration.

This code forms the complete structure for a basic box-pushing puzzle game in PuzzleScript. Consider extending the game with more levels or additional mechanics if desired.
