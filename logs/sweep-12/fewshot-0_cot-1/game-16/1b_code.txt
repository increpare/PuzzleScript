To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to resolve the issues with the `Background` object definition. The main problems are:

1. **Color Specification:** The `Background` object color is incorrectly specified as "background". Instead, it should be a recognized color.
2. **Sprite Dimensions:** The background sprite needs to be 5x5 but currently is not.

Here's how we'll address these:

- Assign a proper color from the PuzzleScript palette to the `Background` object. A common choice would be "Black" or "Grey" if you want it to be a neutral color.
- Ensure the `Background` sprite is a 5x5 grid. I'll modify it to match the dimensions.

Let's apply these fixes to the code:

This code should now compile without errors and work as intended. The `Background` object now has a color specified ("Black"), and it is a 5x5 sprite.
