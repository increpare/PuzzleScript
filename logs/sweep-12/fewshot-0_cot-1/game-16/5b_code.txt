To fix the issues in the provided PuzzleScript code, let's go through the error messages one by one and apply the necessary corrections:

1. **Wall Object Definition Errors**: The Wall object is specified with a single color (Gray) available in the color palette, but the matrix representation suggests there is more than one distinct character used in the design (e.g., `X`). We should ensure to use consistent character representation in accordance with its defined color.

2. **Target Object Definition Errors**: The Target object is colored Green, but the attempt to use symbols suggests multiple colors or inconsistencies. Since color index `2` is referenced but only one color (Green) defined, the matrix for these objects needs to be corrected.

3. **BoxOnTarget Object Definition Errors**: Similar to the Target object, the BoxOnTarget object uses a color index `3`, which is inconsistent with its defined color palette stating there is only one color (DarkRed).

Here's the corrected code addressing these issues:

**Explanation of Fixes:**

- Ensure all objects' sprite definitions consistently use characters that can be represented within their defined color palettes.
- Replaced erroneous characters in the Target and BoxOnTarget matrices with `0` to represent the consistent use of a single color and to ensure correct generation of these objects within the game.
