The error messages indicate that the compiler is interpreting the comment markers `//` and text following them as object names or rule components. This error arises because PuzzleScript comments are not typically denoted with `//`. Instead, we usually add comments directly in text without any specific comment syntax, although this can sometimes vary based on unofficial or specific versions and setups of PuzzleScript engines.

To fix the errors and ensure that the code is functional, we need to remove comment syntax (`//`) and the comments. This will allow the compiler to interpret the rules correctly. Let’s edit the code accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the game code:

I removed the comments to ensure the code compiles without errors. This code should perform correctly if PuzzleScript’s comment guidelines are followed correctly.
