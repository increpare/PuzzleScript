To fix the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to address issues with the color definitions for the `Player` and `Wall` objects. The error messages indicate that we're trying to use a color that isn't defined in the color palette for these objects.

PuzzleScript sprites are defined with a color palette and are represented by a grid of numbers. Each number corresponds to a color in the palette, starting from 0. The `Player` and `Wall` objects attempt to use colors assigned to index 1, but only one color, at index 0, is defined for each object.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Define the color palette correctly for the `Player` and `Wall` objects.
2. Ensure that the grid pattern uses indices that correspond to the defined palette.

Let's correct the color definitions.

**Key Adjustments:**
- Changed the `Player` and `Wall` palettes to ensure proper color indexing (using `0` since there's only one color in their palettes). 
- This fixes the error with attempting to access a non-existent color in the palette. The game should now compile without errors and work correctly.
