To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to focus on several key components: defining the game title, objects, legend, sounds, collision layers, rules, levels, and win conditions. The game should be simple yet engaging, adhering to PuzzleScript's limitations and strengths. I'll design a basic Sokoban-style game where the player pushes boxes onto target spaces, which is a common and well-understood game type.

### Plan
1. **Title and Metadata**: Start with a game title and any other metadata.
2. **Objects**: Define all the objects/sprites, including the player, boxes, targets, and walls.
3. **Legend**: Map characters to objects for use in levels.
4. **Sounds**: Determine the sound feedback for actions.
5. **Collision Layers**: Define the layers to control interactions between objects.
6. **Rules**: Create rules for game mechanics such as movement and winning conditions.
7. **Levels**: Design several levels to challenge the player.
8. **Win Conditions**: Establish how the player wins a level, e.g., all boxes on targets.

Now, I'll write the PuzzleScript code for this game:

### Explanation of Components
- **Title and Metadata**: Sets the game's name as "Sokoban Puzzle."
- **Objects**: Define the player, walls, boxes, targets, and combinations of boxes on targets using simple bitmap patterns.
- **Legend**: Maps characters to these object sprites for use in levels.
- **Collision Layers**: Ensures proper interaction order; e.g., player can only push boxes, and boxes interact with targets.
- **Rules**: Handle player movement, pushing of boxes, and state changes when boxes hit targets.
- **Win Conditions**: Game is won when all boxes are on targets.
- **Levels**: Provides three varying complexity levels to challenge the player.

This PuzzleScript game leverages classic puzzle mechanics in a straightforward yet instructive way, perfect for illustrating what's possible with this language.
