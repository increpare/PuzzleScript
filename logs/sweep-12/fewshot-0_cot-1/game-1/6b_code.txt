To repair the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the specific errors mentioned in the console output:

1. **Wall Sprite Definition**: The error lines related to Wall suggest that thereâ€™s a misalignment or an issue with the sprite character representation. The "r" characters may be causing confusion. We'll ensure that each row of characters in the sprite matrix is of the same length.

2. **Player Sprite Definition**: Similar to the Wall issue, for the Player sprite, there are inconsistencies or misplaced characters. We need to ensure the definition is consistent with expectations in PuzzleScript.

We will take these steps to fix the errors:

- Correct the alignment and length of each line within the Wall and Player sprite matrices.
- Ensure sprite representations use the correct characters length matching in rows

Here's the corrected version of the code:

In this fixed version, I've ensured the sprite matrices adhere to the dimensions and character usage expected by PuzzleScript (namely, each row maintains a strict column limit, and representations utilize period placeholders or dots correctly alongside colored square definition). This should resolve the reported issues during compilation.
