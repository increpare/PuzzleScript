Creating a PuzzleScript game involves defining the basic components of the game such as objects, levels, and rules, and then linking these components together in a coherent way. Here's the best plan of action to develop a simple PuzzleScript game:

1. **Define the Objects**: Create visual representations for all elements in the game. This includes the player, walls, targets, and movable objects (like boxes in a Sokoban-style game).

2. **Define the Legend**: This section assigns a character on the map to each object. It helps in designing levels using simple characters.

3. **Define the Rules**: Establish the logic for how objects interact. This is where you'll handle player movement and any win conditions.

4. **Define the Win Conditions**: Set the conditions that need to be met to win the game (like pushing all boxes onto targets).

5. **Design the Levels**: Create puzzle levels that players can solve by interacting with the objects under the defined rules.

With this plan, I'll create a simple Sokoban-inspired PuzzleScript game where the player pushes boxes onto targets.

### Explanation:

1. **Objects**: Each game object is defined with a name, color, and visual representation. The `Player`, `Wall`, `Box`, `Target`, and `BoxOnTarget` are created with distinguishing colors.
   
2. **Legend**: Assigns shorthand characters for each game object to simplify level designing and rule-writing.

3. **Rules**: Allow the player to move and interact with boxes. Boxes pushed onto targets turn into a `BoxOnTarget`, which satisfies win conditions.

4. **Win Conditions**: Defines a win state where all `Box` objects must be on `Target` tiles.

5. **Levels**: Provides a sample level with a simple layout that includes walls, the player, boxes, and targets.

This concise yet complete code allows for a simple yet enjoyable Sokoban-like experience with the capability to expand further with additional levels or mechanics.
