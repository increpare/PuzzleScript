To fix the code, we need to address the following errors:

1. **Wall Sprite Color Error:** The Wall object uses the color 'RED', but the pixel art uses '1' which is correct if '1' represents the position in the sprite matrix which matches the color defined. However, each character should be within the range of defined color indices (0, 1, 2, etc.), based on the declared colors.

2. **Box Sprite Error:** The error indicates that the sprite definition for Box contains junk characters. The '.b.' and 'bbb' lines introduce characters '.' and 'b' that the parser does not recognize from the color palette or expect in this specific sprite configuration.

### Plan of Action:

- Ensure that the character values in the `Wall` sprite correspond with a valid color index.
- Adjust the use of characters in `Box` so that the sprite matrix uses valid indices (e.g., '0' for the specified main color of the object) and matches the pattern usage.

Letâ€™s rewrite the code based on this analysis:

In this corrected version:

- **Wall:** The sprite pattern uses '1' consistently, linking directly to the 'RED' color with no syntax issues.
- **Box:** The sprite pattern now uses consistent color indices aligned with the single defined color 'BROWN'. The removal of the '.' and 'b' characters ensures clarity in the color palette used.
