To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to diagnose and correct the issues causing the compilation failure. Here's the plan:

1. **Error Analysis:**
   - The errors reported suggest issues with the sprite definitions under `OBJECTS`. The first error indicates that the game expected a color name, but it got 'rrrr' instead. This suggests that color was not defined correctly for the Wall object.
   - Similar errors are shown for the Player object, which indicates there's inconsistent formatting in the sprite matrix.

2. **Approach for Correction:**
   - Ensure each object's color definition is correctly formatted by following PuzzleScript's conventions.
   - Verify that the sprite matrix accurately uses the character for colors, ensuring that the matrix dimensions are correct.

3. **Fixing the Code:**
   - Correct the color signature by inserting the appropriate color name instead of utilizing part of the sprite matrix (`r` in this case).
   - Carefully inspect the object matrix to ensure that only valid characters and dimensions are used.

Here is the fixed code:
