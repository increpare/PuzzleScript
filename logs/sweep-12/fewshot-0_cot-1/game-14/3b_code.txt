The error messages indicate that the colors specified for the objects are not being correctly interpreted by PuzzleScript. Typically, in a PuzzleScript game, color should be specified correctly to ensure the compilation works without errors.

In this case, the `color` keyword is not valid syntax in PuzzleScript. Instead, PuzzleScript uses a percentage system for color, which defines how much of each primary color is present.

I'll correct the mistakes by properly assigning colors as percentages in the OBJECTS section and then return the corrected code.

```plaintext

OBJECTS
===========
Background
transparent

Wall

# Convert a BlockOnGoal back to a Block if it moves away from a Goal
[BlockOnGoal | ~Goal] -> [Block | Goal]

```

In this corrected version, I've removed the incorrect `color` syntax and kept it simple as PuzzleScript allows using predefined color names. This should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the original logic and design of the game.
