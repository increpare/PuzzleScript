To resolve the errors in the PuzzleScript code, let's analyze each of the issues:

1. **Error at line 51:** The error indicates that the "~Goal" object does not exist. In PuzzleScript, the tilde (~) is used to denote negation or absence of an object, and it must reference an existing object. In this case, `Goal` is defined, but the syntax in rules should correctly use the tilde with the object like `No Goal`, if there's an "empty" layer considered after removal of `BlockOnGoal`.

2. **Errors at line 61:** The errors at this line state that keys "/", "L", "E", "V", "1" are not defined. On inspection, these letters appear in the level description comments. PuzzleScript isn't effectively handling inline comments, so let's correct it by utilizing `message` instead to avoid mixing comments into levels.

Let's proceed with making these corrections:

```plaintext

transparent

blue

Wall
black

Block

[Block | Goal] -> [ | BlockOnGoal]

[BlockOnGoal No Goal] -> [Block | Goal]

All BlockOnGoal

===========
LEVELS
===========
message Level 1
########
#..   #
# PB# #
# BB. #
#   G #
########
```

In this version, I've replaced the potentially incorrect absence notation with `No Goal` in one of the rules, using `No` as it is the correct approach for checking the presence of space in the absence of an object like `Goal`. I also substituted the inline comments with `message` usage which allows annotating levels without interrupting their parsing.
