The error messages indicate that the game is missing color assignments for each defined object in the OBJECTS section. PuzzleScript requires that each object is assigned a specific color using the RGB format or color name. In the erroneous code, the keyword "color" is provided, but no actual color value follows it. I'll fix this by providing valid color values. Here is the corrected version of the game code:

```plaintext
===========
OBJECTS
===========
Background
color "transparent"

Player
color "blue"

Wall
color "black"

Block
color "brown"

Goal
color "yellow"

BlockOnGoal
color "green"

===========
LEGEND
===========
P = Player
# = Wall
B = Block
. = Goal
G = BlockOnGoal

===========
SOUNDS
===========

===========
COLLISIONLAYERS
===========
Background
Wall
Goal
Block, BlockOnGoal
Player

===========
RULES
===========
[Player | Block] -> [ | Player Block]  // Move player and push block

# Convert a Block into a BlockOnGoal when on a Goal
[Block | Goal] -> [ | BlockOnGoal]

# Convert a BlockOnGoal back to a Block if it moves away from a Goal
[BlockOnGoal | ~Goal] -> [Block | Goal]

===========
WINCONDITIONS
===========
All BlockOnGoal

===========
LEVELS
===========
// Level 1
########
#..   #
# PB# #
# BB. #
#   G #
########
```

In this repaired code:

- Each object has been assigned a valid color like `"transparent"`, `"blue"`, etc.
- The color values have been enclosed in quotes as required to ensure proper parsing by the PuzzleScript engine.

This should resolve the error messages regarding missing colors and allow the game to compile correctly.
