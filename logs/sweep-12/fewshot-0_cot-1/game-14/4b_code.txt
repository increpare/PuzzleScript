The errors in the PuzzleScript game code are due to comments within the `RULES` section that are not properly formatted. PuzzleScript does not support inline comments or any type of comments within a section of rules. To fix these errors, remove the inline comments within the `RULES` section. However, you can keep comments outside the sections to maintain readability. Here is the corrected code:

```plaintext
===========
OBJECTS
===========
Background
transparent

Player
blue

Wall
black

Block
brown

Goal
yellow

BlockOnGoal
green

===========
LEGEND
===========
P = Player
# = Wall
B = Block
. = Goal
G = BlockOnGoal

===========
SOUNDS
===========

===========
COLLISIONLAYERS
===========
Background
Wall
Goal
Block, BlockOnGoal
Player

===========
RULES
===========
[Player | Block] -> [ | Player Block]

[Block | Goal] -> [ | BlockOnGoal]

[BlockOnGoal | ~Goal] -> [Block | Goal]

===========
WINCONDITIONS
===========
All BlockOnGoal

===========
LEVELS
===========
// Level 1
########
#..   #
# PB# #
# BB. #
#   G #
########
```

The comments inside the `RULES` section have been removed, as PuzzleScript does not support them within this section. The game should now compile without errors.
