To resolve the errors, we need to address several issues highlighted in the console output.

1. **Non-rectangular Level Map**: The "Maps must be rectangular" error indicates that each row in the level map must be of the same length. We will adjust the level map to ensure each row has an equal number of characters.

2. **Invalid level map symbol**: The message indicates that the space character " " is used in the level map but not defined. In PuzzleScript, spaces are typically not explicitly defined in the legend as they default to 'Background'. However, to ensure clarity, we will use the defined background symbol ` ` (a space character) correctly.

3. **Rules with mismatched patterns**: The error highlighting the rule pattern lengths likely means that the patterns do not match in cell count on both sides of the rule. We'll fix this by ensuring they are correctly paired.

Here's the corrected code, addressing these issues:

```

**Adjustments Made:**

1. **Level Rectangularity**: Checked the map from line 64 to line 68 to ensure each line has 8 characters, including walls and spaces.

2. **Rule Patterns**: Corrected the rules in lines 50 and 52 to ensure the patterns have matched lengths (the number of cells) by adding missing vertical bars `|`.

By resolving these issues, no errors should prevent the game from compiling and running correctly.
