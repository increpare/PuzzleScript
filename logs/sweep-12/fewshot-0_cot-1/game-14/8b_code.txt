To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to fix several issues:

1. **Equal Signs Format Error:** The error message "Only comments should go after a bunch of equals signs ('===')" suggests that the structure is not properly formatted according to PuzzleScript standards. Ensure `===` sections don't have misplaced titles or entries.

2. **Rectangular Map Errors:** The level map lines throw errors about maps needing to be rectangular. This means each row in a level definition must have the same number of characters. Identify the shortest row and pad it with background symbols to match the longest row.

3. **Symbol Not Found:** The message about the symbol " " (space) indicates that a space is used instead of the defined background symbol. In PuzzleScript, a single space often denotes the background, but it must be referenced correctly as per the objects and legend definitions.

4. **Rule Syntax Error:** The syntax issue in the rules section suggests that the patterns on the left and right of a rule might not be correctly matched. Specifically, the rule `[Block | Goal] -> [ | BlockOnGoal]` is not aligned properly in terms of sequence and can be adjusted to separate the condition and result clearly with proper pattern matching.

Here's the corrected code:

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Level Map Fix:** Ensure all rows in the level map are of equal length. The original code's level design seemed correct, but ensure all `=` characters follow title/sections correctly.

2. **Rules Standardization:** Adjusted the rule to `[Block | Goal] -> [BlockOnGoal | ]` which ensures the syntax is followed correctly with matched pattern lengths. Double-verify alignment in the rules to ensure they're structured correctly â€“ they matched here but confirmed no deviation from syntax allowed.

3. **Background Character Adjustment:** Ensure the single space used for the background is properly recognized. This wasn't the root of the current error, but some tweaking may always appear necessary.

By making these adjustments, we aim to resolve the compilation errors and produce a functioning Sokoban-style game in PuzzleScript.
