To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to define several key components:

1. **Objects**: The building blocks of the game, such as players, blocks, goals, walls, etc.
2. **Legend**: A mapping of single-character symbols to the objects defined.
3. **Colors**: The color representation for each of the objects.
4. **Sounds**: Optional sound effects for game actions.
5. **CollisionLayers**: Define how objects interact or block each other.
6. **Rules**: The set of logic that defines game mechanics and interactions.
7. **Win Conditions**: The criteria that must be met for a player to win the level.
8. **Levels**: The actual layout of objects for one or more levels.

With these in mind, I'll design a simple Sokoban-like game where the player pushes blocks onto goal spaces to win. Let's go through the components:

1. **Objects**: We need objects for the player, the wall, a block (crate), a goal, and a block on a goal.
2. **Legend**: We'll use symbols like `P` for player, `#` for wall, `B` for block, `.` for goal, and `G` for a block on a goal.
3. **Colors**: Assign distinct colors to make each object visually recognizable.
4. **Sounds**: Optional in this example as it focuses on core functionality.
5. **CollisionLayers**: Separate out immovable objects like walls from player and blocks which can move.
6. **Rules**: Define interactions like moving, pushing blocks, and handling blocks on goals.
7. **Win Conditions**: Define that a win is achieved when all blocks have been pushed onto goals.
8. **Levels**: Provide one example level to demonstrate gameplay.

Here's the code for the PuzzleScript game:

### Explanation:

- **Objects** and **Colors** are straightforward definitions that specify our game entities and their display color.
- **Legend** defines shorthand symbols for those entities in level definitions.
- **CollisionLayers** ensure that walls are distinct, and blocks are in a separate layer.
- **Rules** cover moving the player, pushing blocks, and transforming blocks when positioned on goals.
- **WinConditions** specify victory when all blocks are on goals.
- The **Level** offers a simple puzzle where the player (`P`) must push blocks (`B`) onto goals (`.`) to win.

This simple game should be a good starting point for anyone wishing to explore PuzzleScript further.
