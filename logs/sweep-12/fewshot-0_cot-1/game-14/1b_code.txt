The error messages indicate that the game is missing color assignments for each defined object in the OBJECTS section. PuzzleScript requires that each object is assigned a specific color using the RGB format or color name. In the erroneous code, the keyword "color" is provided, but no actual color value follows it. I'll need to assign appropriate colors following the keyword for each object.

Plan of action:
1. Assign a valid color to each object in the OBJECTS section.
2. Maintain the initial colors described where possible but ensure they are in a format recognized by PuzzleScript.

Here's the repaired code:

```plaintext
===========
OBJECTS
===========
Background
color Transparent

Player
color Blue

Wall
color Black

Block
color Brown

Goal
color Yellow

BlockOnGoal
color Green

===========
LEGEND
===========
P = Player
# = Wall
B = Block
. = Goal
G = BlockOnGoal

===========
SOUNDS
===========

===========
COLLISIONLAYERS
===========
Background
Wall
Goal
Block, BlockOnGoal
Player

===========
RULES
===========
[Player | Block] -> [ | Player Block]  // Move player and push block

# Convert a Block into a BlockOnGoal when on a Goal
[Block | Goal] -> [ | BlockOnGoal]

# Convert a BlockOnGoal back to a Block if it moves away from a Goal
[BlockOnGoal | ~Goal] -> [Block | Goal]

===========
WINCONDITIONS
===========
All BlockOnGoal

===========
LEVELS
===========
// Level 1
########
#..   #
# PB# #
# BB. #
#   G #
########
```

The corrected code should now compile without errors since each object has been assigned a color properly.
