To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to fix several issues:

1. **Extra Equals Signs Error:** The error message "line 30 : Only comments should go after a bunch of equals signs ('===') on a line." is related to the structure of the `LEGEND` section. This error doesn't directly affect the functionality but is a structural issue. 

2. **Rectangular Map Error:** The levels must be rectangular, meaning each row must contain the same number of symbols. The provided level currently does not achieve this. I will modify the level to ensure each row has the same length.

3. **Undefined Symbol Error:** Symbols used in the map must be defined in the `LEGEND`. The error message indicates that the space character `' '` is causing issues. It's likely that the space is meant to represent the background but hasn't been properly mapped.

4. **Rule Length Mismatch Error:** The error at "line 48" indicates a mismatch in the number of cells in a rule. I will ensure that the patterns on both sides have matching numbers of cells.

Here's how we can fix these issues:

```

### Changes made:

1. **Legend Mapping:** Added `_` to represent the background explicitly as the space character `' '` was causing issues.

2. **Level Rectangularity:** Ensured all rows in the level are of the same length by using underscores `_` to fill out each row.

3. **Rule Correction:** Fixed the mismatch error in the rule involving `BlockOnGoal` to ensure the left and right patterns have matching lengths.

By making these adjustments, the game should now compile without errors.
