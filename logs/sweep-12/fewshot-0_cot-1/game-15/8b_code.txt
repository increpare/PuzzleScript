The errors in the console output indicate issues related to the color definitions for the `Background` object. Specifically, it seems that the `Background` object is defined with invalid or duplicate color specifications, leading to confusion in the game engine. The PuzzleScript sprite definitions should consist of a certain number of colors in the binary format, rather than using hex color values directly in each sprite row.

In PuzzleScript, the colors for objects are defined using a grid of numbers representing colors from a specified palette. The sprite for each object contains numbers that map to these colors, with `0` typically being used to represent transparency or no color.

To fix these errors, we need to define each sprite properly using numbers that reference colors from a palette, rather than directly using the hex color values. The palette itself will need to be defined at the top of the object definitions. I will demonstrate how to fix the `Background` object:

1. Define a palette at the start of the object section.
2. Use numbers instead of hex codes in the sprite for each object, referring to the assigned colors in the palette.

Let's update the game code accordingly:

```

In this updated version, I've introduced a `palette` section at the beginning of the objects section to define color mapping. For each object, I've replaced the hexadecimal color values in the sprites with numbers corresponding to the palette. This should resolve the errors reported in the console output.
