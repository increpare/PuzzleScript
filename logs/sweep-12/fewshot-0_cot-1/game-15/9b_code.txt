Let's take a look at the initial error and reason through it to devise a plan:

- The console errors indicate an issue with the `palette` section at lines 10 and 11. The errors tell us that the game is attempting to access color values where none exist and that there are unexpected entries described as "junk" within the section.

Upon inspection, it seems there's a formatting mistake in the `palette` section. In PuzzleScript, the palette entries should not be put in a section labeled `objects`. Instead, they should be directly included in the code and properly organized.

Here is the fixed game code with the `palette` section formatted correctly, and removed from the `objects` section:

```

This revised version should correctly define the colors for the objects as specified by the PuzzleScript game description language, fixing the issues noted during initial compilation.
