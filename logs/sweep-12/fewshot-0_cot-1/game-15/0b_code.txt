To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to consider several important elements, including defining the game's theme and mechanics, specifying the different objects, creating rules for interactions, and designing levels. Since the goal is to deliver a complete game and within a reasonable complexity due to the concise nature of PuzzleScript, I will aim for a simple yet engaging puzzle game.

**Game Concept: "Key Quest"**

- **Theme:** Player must collect keys to unlock a door and reach the exit.
- **Objects:** Player, Wall, Key, Door, Exit.
- **Rules:** The player can move in four directions. If the player touches a key, it disappears. The door unlocks when all keys are collected.
- **Levels:** Simple levels requiring strategy to collect keys efficiently and reach the exit.

**Plan:**
1. Define the title of the game.
2. Specify the objects in the game.
3. Create the player movements and interactions with objects.
4. Establish rules for collecting keys and opening the door.
5. Design a few levels to illustrate the gameplay mechanics.

Here is the implementation in PuzzleScript's language:

# Key Collection

# Open Door when all keys are collected
late [ Key ] -> [ Key ]
[ Door ] -> [ Exit ]

# Winning Condition
[ Player | Exit ] -> win

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects**: We defined five objects - the player, walls, keys, doors, and exits, each with a distinct color.
2. **Legends**: The symbols represent each object in the levels.
3. **Sounds** (optional feature): Added potential sound events when a key is collected, the door opens, and the player wins.
4. **Rules**: The rules dictate player movement, key collection, and how the door turns into an exit once all keys are collected. The game is won when the player reaches the exit.
5. **Levels**: Two simple levels are crafted to exhibit the core mechanic of collecting keys to unlock the door and then advancing to the exit. The complexity of levels can be increased based on learning and strategy application by the player.

This concise design offers expandable gameplay while maintaining simplicity and clarity in code and logic.
