The errors point to issues at the start of the game description, specifically within the palette section where it seems to be misconfigured. In PuzzleScript, each item in the palette section should be specified on its own line. We should also pay attention to allow 3 or 6 hex digits without the hash symbol, as thatâ€™s how colors are expected in this context.

Furthermore, the declaration of sounds should be checked; PuzzleScript typically does not support a 'sounds' section like the one attempts to define. Sounds are usually tied to the game engine implementation details, which are often hardcoded or part of external configuration rather than user-defined script language files.

Additionally, as a game designed to compile in PuzzleScript, direct visual representation such as level designs or object definitions require correct alignment and syntax according to the specifics of this scripting language to be rendered properly during execution.

Now let's rewrite the game code, ensuring adherence to the PuzzleScript language conventions:

```
The changes made:
1. Removed the `sounds` section, as PuzzleScript doesn't traditionally support this way of defining sounds.
2. Fixed the object sprite definitions to be correctly lined with five rows of five characters for each sprite.
