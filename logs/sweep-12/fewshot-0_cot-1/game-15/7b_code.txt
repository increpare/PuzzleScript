The errors mentioned in the console output indicate a problem with sprite definitions, specifically with how the colors are defined. Each sprite should be defined with a 5x5 grid using specified colors. However, it seems like the system is not recognizing the color definitions due to possibly incorrect formatting or errors in color input.

Here's how to fix it:
1. Colors in PuzzleScript are defined as hexadecimal codes prefixed with 0x. For instance, "000000" for black should be written as "0x000000".
2. Each sprite definition needs exactly 5 color numbers for each of the 5 lines, totaling 25 entries.

Let's correct the color definitions and ensure each sprite has a 5x5 grid.

This corrected version addresses the color format issue, providing PuzzleScript with a recognizable color definition by prefixing each color with `0x`.
