The errors in the provided PuzzleScript code are due to invalid color definitions for the `Background` and `Wall` objects. In PuzzleScript, sprites are defined using colors, which are determined by the color palette provided or specified using names (like `red`, `blue`, etc.). The strings you provided (`00000`) are not valid colors or color names in this context.

To correct these errors, I will:
1. Use a color name instead of `00000` for the `Background` sprite.
2. Use a standard color name for the `Wall` object.
3. Ensure that all sprite definitions use valid predefined or standard color names.

Here's how the revised code should look:

```

In this corrected version, the `Background` is defined with `black` color, and the `Wall` with `blue`. These are valid color definitions which should resolve the compilation errors.
