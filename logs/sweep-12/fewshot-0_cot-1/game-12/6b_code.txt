The errors in the PuzzleScript game code are due to entries in the "METADATA" section being misinterpreted as needing definitions in earlier parts of the script. PuzzleScript doesn't require or recognize separate metadata fields in its scripts as it processes the code sequentially. Therefore, any text in unexpected sections may lead to errors for unused objects or keys that were not defined in the "LEGEND" or "OBJECTS".

Here's how we can fix the code:
- The "METADATA" field is non-compliant with strict PuzzleScript syntax. To resolve this, it should be removed or commented out, as it isn't required for game functionality.
- Ensure all game elements are correctly described and that the rules and win conditions match what we intend.

With these insights, the repaired version of the code is as follows:

The code above removes the "METADATA" section and retains the functional parts of the script, ensuring compatibility with PuzzleScript standards.
