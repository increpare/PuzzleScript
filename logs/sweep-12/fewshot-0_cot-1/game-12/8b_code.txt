When the console output indicates that an object "TARGET" has not been assigned to a collision layer, it suggests that there's likely an oversight in defining how different objects should behave or interact in the game. Every object that interacts within the game world should be assigned to a collision layer, which controls what can move through or interact with what.

In this Sokoban implementation:
- Each object should be assigned to a relevant collision layer to ensure correct behavior within the game.
- The `Target` object is missing from the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. 
- Ensure that the `Target` object is assigned to the appropriate layer for the game logic to function as intended.

To fix the issue, we'll add the `Target` object to the `COLLISIONLAYERS` so that movement and interactions can be processed correctly. We'll add it in the same layer as the `Crate` and `TargetCrate` since it logically represents positions where crates can be moved or transformed.

Here's the corrected code:

In this corrected version, I've added the `Target` to the same collision layer as `Crate` and `TargetCrate`. This inclusion ensures that `Target` is part of the interaction model when the game processes the movement and placement of crates onto targets.
