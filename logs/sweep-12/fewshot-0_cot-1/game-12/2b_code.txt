To address the errors in the PuzzleScript code, follow these steps:

1. **Fix the Section Order**: Ensure that the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section comes after the `SOUNDS` section.

2. **Define Missing Objects in Legend**: Ensure all object names in rules are defined in the `LEGEND` section using case sensitivity. The objects referenced in the rules do not match those defined in the `OBJECTS` section due to case differences.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure object names are consistently capitalized across definitions, rules, collision layers, and win conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

I ensured that all sections are correctly ordered, added the missing `SOUNDS` section (even if it's empty), and used consistent case across object references.
