To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I need to define its essential components: 

1. **Objects**: These are the building blocks of the game, including players, goals, walls, and other entities.
2. **Legend**: This matches game symbols to their respective objects.
3. **Sounds (optional)**: Specify any sounds that occur during actions.
4. **Collision Layers**: Define interaction layers for game objects to handle movement and collision logic.
5. **Rules**: These govern the interactions and transitions between objects when a player inputs a move.
6. **Win Conditions**: Define what constitutes winning a level, such as moving a player object to a target position.
7. **Levels**: Design the levels themselves using the defined symbols from the legend.
8. **Metadata (optional)**: Provide game title and author information.

For demonstration, I'm going to create a simple "Sokoban" style game where the player needs to push all the crates onto target spots.

Here's the complete code for the game:

### Explanation:
- **Objects**: Defined with colors, each representing a different game entity: walls, a player, crates, and targets.
- **Legend**: Maps characters to objects to simplify level design.
- **Collision Layers**: Built to ensure only relevant interactions occur, stacking permissible objects.
- **Rules**: Ensure crates are pushed and transformed correctly when over targets.
- **Win Conditions**: Specified all crates must be positioned on targets.
- **Levels**: Simple levels designed for introductory gameplay. Each level increases slightly in complexity.
- **Metadata**: Provides basic information like the game's title and author.

This structure offers a straightforward game loop, suitable for newcomers to PuzzleScript as it demonstrates mechanics common to block-pushing puzzles like "Sokoban".
