To address the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to examine each reported issue and correct it as follows:

1. **Sound Declaration Issue**: 
   - The error suggests there is an issue related to sound declarations. The `SOUNDS` section is empty with just a comment. We can remove the `SOUNDS` section if it's not needed since PuzzleScript doesn't require an empty sounds section.

2. **Unrecognized Characters in Levels**:
   - The errors regarding keys like `;`, `I`, `N`, `R`, etc., suggest there are unexpected characters in the levels (likely from the comments included after the levels). To fix this, the comments that include level descriptions (like `; Introductory Level`) should be on a separate line, or we should remove the level comments that cause parsing issues.

Here's the corrected version with these changes applied:

In the fixed version:
- The `SOUNDS` section was removed since it was not being used.
- Comments that caused parsing issues due to being on the same line as level data were moved to separate lines above the levels.
