The errors indicate that there is an issue with the rule patterns on lines 56 and 57. In PuzzleScript, the rule on the left side must have a corresponding pattern of the same length on the right side. 

Looking at the rules:
- `[ Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate ]`: This rule is correctly written, as it handles the player pushing the crate forward.
- `[ Crate | Target ] -> [ TargetCrate ]`: The left side has two patterns (Crate and Target) and the right side only has one (TargetCrate). We need to ensure the right side has the same number of elements as the left side.
- `[ TargetCrate | Crate ] -> [ TargetCrate ]`: Similarly, this rule has two input patterns and one output pattern. We need to balance this rule as well.
- `[ TargetCrate ] -> [ Crate ]`: This rule is correctly written and doesn't need changes.

To resolve these issues, each side of the rules on lines 56 and 57 should contain the same number of patterns. Hereâ€™s how we can address this:
- `[ Crate | Target ] -> [ TargetCrate | Target ]`
- `[ TargetCrate | Crate ] -> [ TargetCrate | Target ]`

Here's the corrected version of the code:

This change ensures that both the input and output of the problematic rules have an equal number of elements, complying with PuzzleScript's rule requirements and resolving the compilation errors.
