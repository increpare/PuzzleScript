The errors in the output suggest that there's an issue with the commented line "; Introductory Level." PuzzleScript does not support inline comments prefixed with a semicolon or any other special character. Comments can be added in the PuzzleScript editor by using separate single-line comment syntax with no special prefixes. Additionally, the rules section has some unnecessary transformations, and the target and target crate logic should be refined for simplicity.

Let's fix the game code by removing the inline comments, simplifying the rules, and ensuring that all errors are addressed.

In this corrected version of the game code:
- Removed the commented labels in the levels section, as PuzzleScript treats such text as invalid tokens.
- Simplified the rules to ensure they correctly handle the interactions between crates, targets, and walls.
- Maintained consistency in the formatting and structures supported by PuzzleScript.
