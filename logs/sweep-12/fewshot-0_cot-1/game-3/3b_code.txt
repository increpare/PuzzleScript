To solve the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to correct the following issues:

1. **Color Specification:** The issue is that the player object does not have its color specified correctly. In PuzzleScript, color definitions come immediately after the object's name and are listed one color per line, following the dot notation for the object's art representation. Each object should have a specific color defined before its design pattern.

2. **Player's Color:** The color should be specified correctly after the object name "Player" and before its pattern.

3. **Order of definitions:** Ensure that all elements follow the correct syntax and that colors match their respective objects without unintended new object definitions.

Here's my plan of action to fix these issues:
- Make sure each object has its color specified immediately following its name.
- Ensure the design pattern for each object follows the color line without inadvertently starting a new definition.
- Reformat the game code according to the standard structure of a PuzzleScript game.

Here's the corrected PuzzleScript code:
