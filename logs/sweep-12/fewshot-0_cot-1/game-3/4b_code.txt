To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we will need to follow these steps:

1. **Correct Section Order**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section needs to be correctly ordered to follow the `SOUNDS` section, even if `SOUNDS` is empty.

2. **Correct Case in Rules**: The names used in the rules are case-sensitive and must match exactly with those defined in the `LEGEND` section. We'll update the rules to use the correct case for the object names.

By following these steps, we can repair the code. Here's the corrected version of the code:

**Summary of Changes:**

- Added the `SOUNDS` section (empty) as required.
- Corrected the case of object names in the `RULES` section to match the definitions in the `LEGEND`. Specifically:
  - Changed `Player` to `P`
  - Changed `Crate` to `C`
  - Changed `Target` to `T`
  - Changed `CrateOnTarget` to `G`

This repaired code should compile and run without the reported errors.
