When reviewing the given PuzzleScript code, it appears that there are issues in the object definitions where each object is not correctly separated by any newline or "separator line" (i.e., using `;`). Each object should have its definition on a separate line for readability and to circumvent the errors arising from the current format.

The error messages suggest that the compiler is getting confused with the way the object colors are being read. These problems can be fixed by ensuring each object is on a separate line and there's no misplaced text causing confusion for color values.

Let's revise the code by placing each object definition in the `objects` section on its own line.

Changes Made:
1. Placed each object definition in the `objects` section on its own separate line.
2. Removed commas from the RGB color components to match the expected syntax in PuzzleScript.

With these corrections, the code should compile without errors.
