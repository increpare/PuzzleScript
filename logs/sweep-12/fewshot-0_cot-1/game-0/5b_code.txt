The errors encountered in the PuzzleScript game code seem to originate from issues in the definition of the objects where plain integers are used as object names, causing naming conflicts. The colors of the objects were placed incorrectly, potentially because of whitespace or syntax mistakes. To address these, we need to ensure each object has a correctly formatted line with a unique, meaningful name, followed by its color. The syntax for defining objects was not strictly followed, with colors or lines perhaps being misplaced. Here's a step-by-step plan for fixing the issues:

1. Correct the object definitions by ensuring that each object line starts with its unique name followed by its intended color values. Avoid using numbers as object or color identifiers unless part of a structured format.
2. Reassign the correct colors to each object while ensuring valid syntax.

Here's the repaired version of the PuzzleScript code with the necessary corrections:

This code should now compile correctly, assuming that each object's color codes were intended as such in the initial description.
