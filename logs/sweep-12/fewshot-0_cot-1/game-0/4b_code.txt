The error messages indicate that there are issues with the colors assigned to the objects. Colors in PuzzleScript should be specified using unique RGB values. In this case, it seems like the colors have been improperly assigned or repeated, causing conflicts.

To fix these issues, we will:
1. Ensure that each object's color is unique and properly defined.
2. Use consistent naming for color values, avoiding direct numbers for object names.

Let's update the color values for each object to be unique and modify the faulty lines, ensuring they follow a consistent pattern. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

In this corrected version, I slightly altered the RGB values for the `Background` object to ensure they are distinct from the `Wall` and `Target`. The rest of the objects already have unique colors, so they remain unchanged. The adjusted values prevent naming conflicts and fulfill the requirement for unique color assignments in `PuzzleScript`.
