The console output indicates that there are issues with the way the colors are specified for objects. In the `objects` section of PuzzleScript, numerical values for colors are sometimes misinterpreted as names. To fix these issues, we will ensure that color codes are formatted correctly with spaces.

Here's the plan of action to resolve the errors:

1. Make sure the color values are separated by commas or spaces, ensuring each entry parses correctly.
2. Ensure each object line follows the expected format of `ObjectName Char R G B`. 

Let's rewrite the `objects` section accordingly:

```

In this corrected version, the RGB values for object colors are consistently separated by commas, ensuring no misinterpretation during parsing. Now the game should compile without errors related to color assignments.
