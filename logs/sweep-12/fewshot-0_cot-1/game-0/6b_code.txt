To resolve the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to address several issues that arise mainly from syntax errors in the 'objects' section. Here is a breakdown of the necessary corrections:

1. In the 'objects' definition, each object's color is defined by three separate numbers that correspond to RGB values. The syntax is being misinterpreted because of the commas and spaces used incorrectly.
2. Ensure that each object definition starts on a new line.
3. Verify that all necessary sections of the script follow proper syntax, especially with object color definition, where RGB values must be separated by spaces.

Let's correct these errors:

```

Let's go through the corrections:

- The object definitions remain the same, but ensure each line has clear separation between object name, symbol, and RGB color values.
- Double-check the 'winconditions' section to ensure 'All Box on Target' is the correct end condition.
- Review levels for correct map representation with '#' being Wall and '.' representing Background for clarity.

Feel free to add or modify more components if further debugging is required through testing.
