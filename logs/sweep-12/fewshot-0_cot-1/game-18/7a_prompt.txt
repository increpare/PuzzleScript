produced the following console output:
=================================
line 56 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 57 : Unknown junk in object section (possibly: sprites have to be 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels high exactly. Or maybe: the main names for objects have to be words containing only the letters a-z0.9 - if you want to call them something like ",", do it in the legend section).
line 66 : In the legend, define new items using the equals symbol - declarations must look like "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]".
line 66 : Incorrect format of legend - should be one of "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]", but it looks like you have a dangling "ERROR"?
line 67 : Incorrect format of legend - should be one of "A = B", "A = B or C [ or D ...]", "A = B and C [ and D ...]".
line 68 : section "COLLISIONLAYERS" is out of order, must follow  "SOUNDS" (or it could be that the section "SOUNDS"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 73 : error detected - unexpected character /
