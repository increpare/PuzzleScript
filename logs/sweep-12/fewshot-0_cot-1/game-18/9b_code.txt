To address the compilation errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to examine and fix the issues based on the console feedback. Here's a breakdown of what needs to be corrected:

1. **Line 56-57**: These lines likely belong to incorrect object definitions or syntax in the `RULES` section. Specifically, these lines should be corrected according to the rules described in the PuzzleScript documentation.

2. **Line 66-67**: There are issues with the `LEGEND` definitions. Each definition should be of the form `"A = B"`, `"A = B or C"`, or `"A = B and C"`. Check these definitions for typos or logical errors.

3. **Line 70-71**: There are missing sound definitions or incorrect formats. If no sounds are used, this section could be simply omitted.

4. **Line 78-80**: These lines indicate problems in the `RULES` section, potentially due to syntax errors. Make sure there are no unexpected characters, and verify the condition formatting.

5. **Collision Layer Error**: There's a reported problem with the `Player` object being placed in multiple collision layers. Each object should appear in one collision layer that appropriately corresponds to its role in the game.

Let's correct these issues step-by-step.

- Remove any superfluous or misnamed objects, particularly in the `COLLISIONLAYERS` and `RULES` sections.
- Verify correct syntax in each section.
- Ensure that the game rules are logically consistent and formatted correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

### Explanation for Changes:
- **Collision Layers**: Adjusted to include `CrateOnTarget` in the same layer as `Crate` for correct interaction.
- **Rules**: Removed and cleaned up incorrect rules and ensured merging of `Crate` with `Target` results in `CrateOnTarget`.
- **Win Condition**: Altered to check that all crates are on the targets by using `All CrateOnTarget`.
- **Removed redundant sections and errors**: Fixed syntax errors, including extraneous rule parts or incorrect split components.
