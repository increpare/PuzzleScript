To address the reported errors and improve the PuzzleScript code, I'll make the following changes:

1. **Correct Object Sprites**: Ensure that all sprite representations are exactly 5x5 pixels.
2. **Legend Definitions**: Properly define legend keys with the "=" symbol.
3. **Insert SOUNDS Section**: Add a placeholder for the SOUNDS section to maintain the correct section order.
4. **Collision Layers**: Ensure each object is correctly assigned without grouping `Background` and `Target` together.
5. **Correct Collision Layers Order**: Define separate layers for background and other interactive objects.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the `Background` sprite to a proper 5x5 blank grid.
- Fixed the legend definitions to correctly associate the symbols with their objects.
- Added a `SOUNDS` section placeholder to maintain correct section order.
- Rearranged the `COLLISIONLAYERS` to ensure `Background` is in its own layer and separate interactive objects correctly. 

This should ensure that the game compiles correctly without errors.
