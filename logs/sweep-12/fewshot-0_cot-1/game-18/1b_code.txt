To fix the issues present in the given PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the following problems:

1. **Sprite Size Error**: PuzzleScript requires objects to be represented by a 5x5 pixel grid. The `CrateOnTarget` sprite is defined as a 4x4 grid, which is incorrect.

2. **Color Error**: The color `LIGHTORANGE` is not defined in PuzzleScript's set of recognized colors. We should replace it with a valid color.

3. **Legend Errors**: There are syntax issues with how the legend is defined, specifically regarding the definitions and newlines.

To repair the code:

- Fix the sprite size for `CrateOnTarget` to be 5x5.
- Use a correct color for `CrateOnTarget`, such as `ORANGE`.
- Ensure that the legend definitions are properly formatted.

Here's the repaired code:

### Key Changes Made:

- Adjusted the `CrateOnTarget` sprite to fit within the 5x5 grid and aligned it with the `ORANGE` color of the `Crate`.
- Ensured all sprite definitions are 5 lines tall to comply with PuzzleScript's requirements.
- Ensured the legend section is properly formatted without syntax errors.
