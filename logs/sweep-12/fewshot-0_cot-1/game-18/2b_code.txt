To address the errors in the original PuzzleScript game code, we'll need to make a few corrections:

1. **CrateOnTarget Sprite**: The error mentions unknown junk in the sprite matrix for `CrateOnTarget`. This likely means there is a non-standard character or format issue. Each sprite character must be a single digit, lowercase letter, or period. `O` is not valid, and we must ensure the sprite is a 5x5 grid using valid characters.

2. **Legend Syntax**: The legend entries should correctly map symbols to objects. This usually follows the format "Symbol = Object" and ensures proper connections between symbols used in levels and the defined objects.

3. **Unused Sound Reference**: The error about `PUSH1` suggests a possible older reference to a sound that was removed. Since sound section is commented out, make sure to remove any such mention if present in unused code or comments to prevent misunderstanding or errors.

4. **Correction of Rule Syntax**: The rules for moving the `Player` and interacting with crates may also need careful review to ensure logic is applied correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the PuzzleScript code:

**Changes Made:**
- Adjusted `CrateOnTarget` sprite to a valid 5x5 grid using appropriate characters.
- Ensured the legend and object names correctly match and symbolize the game elements in a proper format.
- Reviewed and confirmed the rule logic, ensuring that typical Sokoban mechanics are maintained.
- Ensured there are no dangling sound references, commented out any such old definitions. 

Once applied, these changes should address the compilation errors and ensure the game logic functions correctly.
