To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to make several adjustments:

1. **Sprite Definitions**: Ensure that each sprite in the `OBJECTS` section has dimensions of exactly 5x5 characters.
2. **Legend Definitions**: Properly define each object in the `LEGEND` section using the `=` sign.
3. **Section Ordering**: Ensure that the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section follows the `SOUNDS` section (even if the `SOUNDS` section is empty).
4. **Comment Formatting**: Ensure comments are properly formatted with leading `//` throughout.
5. **Rule Syntax**: Fix the rules to correctly handle player movement and object interactions.
6. **Win Condition**: Ensure the correct win condition logic.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

This revised code ensures that the game can compile correctly in PuzzleScript. It fixes sprite dimensions, properly defines objects in the legend, adheres to the correct section order, corrects syntax errors, and maintains the intended game functionality.
