Upon examining the provided PuzzleScript game code, several issues are identified which lead to errors during the compilation process. We must address each of these errors step by step:

1. **Sprite Dimensions**: Each sprite in the OBJECTS section must be exactly 5x5 in size. The error lines are indicating problems with some sprites not meeting these requirements.

2. **Legend Section Formatting**: The legend needs to have each mapping correctly formed as `A = B`, where `A` is a single character, and `B` represents an object or a combination of objects.

3. **Collision Layer Issue**: The `Player` object appears in multiple collision layers, which is disallowed. The collision layer should be organized to avoid this conflict.

4. **Syntax Errors and Misplaced Characters**: Remove excess or misplaced characters such as `[" and `|` which could be causing parsing errors.

5. **Faulty Rules**: Some rules seem incorrect because they're not considering possible stacking issues correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the code that attempts to resolve these issues:

### Explanation:
- **Sprites**: Each sprite definition is now fixed to be a 5x5 grid, ensuring no formatting errors regarding sprite size.
- **Collision Layers**: Each object type is accounted for only in one layer relevant to its interaction properties.
- **Rules and Legend**: Correct any faulty rules and ensure the legend is formatted properly for parsing.
- **Syntax**: Ensure there are no stray or misplaced symbols in the RULES and other potential syntax issues are corrected.

This corrected version should resolve the errors identified during the initial output and allow for proper compilation and functioning of the game.
