To resolve the issues displayed in the console output, we need to carefully analyze the errors and make adjustments to the code:

1. **Objects Section Error**: 
   - Lines 56 and 57 refer to the object `CrateOnTarget`, which has an extra space in its sprite definition. The sprite must be 5x5 characters with no extra spaces included. This needs fixing.

2. **Legend Section Error**:
   - There are extra spaces or incorrect formats in the legend definitions. Each legend line should properly map a single character to an object name without trailing spaces.

3. **Sounds Section Error**:
   - The error on line 70 and 71 regarding the missing sound event suggests that simply including an empty `SOUNDS` section is causing problems. This can be omitted completely if there are no defined sounds.

4. **Collision Layer Error**:
   - In line 79, the error might have emerged due to an incorrect reference to an object or missing layers; adjust how objects are categorized if needed, ensuring clarity.

5. **Extra Characters and Syntax Errors**: 
   - There are stray or incorrect characters, as mentioned in lines that refer to unexpected `/` characters. This may imply there are misplacements in the code that need tidying up.

Let's fix these errors and return a corrected version of the code:

### Key Fixes Made:

- Removed unused/empty `SOUNDS` section.
- Ensured the collision layer order is correct.
- Removed redundant slashes in comments that were inferred to be problematic.
