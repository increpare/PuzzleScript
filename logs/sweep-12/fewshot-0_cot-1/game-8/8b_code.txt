The errors indicate issues with parsing colors for objects in the PuzzleScript game code. This typically suggests a formatting problem under the `objects` section, likely caused by not having lines separating different sections of the game appropriately. Let's examine the code:

In PuzzleScript, sections like `title`, `author`, `objects`, etc., must be separated by a line of `========`. The issue here probably originates from the placement of these separators, which may have caused errors in parsing the game code despite everything appearing correct.

Tasks:
1. Ensure that each section in the PuzzleScript code is appropriately separated by `========`.
2. Check the `objects` section to ensure each object declaration is formatted correctly.

Given this, I will fix the code to ensure each section is correctly separated and formatted:

The code is corrected to ensure structural integrity by confirming every section starts with a separator line consisting of `========`. This should resolve the parsing errors seen in your troubleshooting console output.
