The errors you are seeing are all related to missing background color declarations on some object entries. In the PuzzleScript language, each object should clearly define its color immediately after the object name and character symbol. The provided game code is missing these color declarations:  

Plan of Action:
- Ensure each object in the 'objects' section has a color hexadecimal code after its defining character. 
- Carefully scan through each object's row to ensure the color section is included and correctly formatted.

Here is your repaired version of the code:

I have reviewed and confirmed that each object now has a color code attached. This should prevent the errors and allow the game code to compile successfully.
