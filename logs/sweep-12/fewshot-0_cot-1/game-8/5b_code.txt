The error messages suggest that there's an issue with how the colors are defined for the objects. Specifically, PuzzleScript is attempting to parse entries in the "objects" section but is failing to do so due to incorrect formattingâ€”likely because of white spaces or mismatched expectation in object property definitions. The error messages indicate that it expects a color definition but encounters the beginning of a new line, suggesting that the format might not be properly aligned or an expected character is missing.

To resolve these issues, we'll do the following:
1. Ensure that the definition for each object in the "objects" section has the correct format: "ObjectName Char Color".
2. Remove any extraneous spaces and ensure that properties are on the same line.
3. Recheck the object definitions and legend entries for consistency.

Here's the repaired version of the game code:

The key task was to ensure that each object in the "objects" section had the proper format with appropriate capitalization and line alignment, correcting the formatting errors that were previously present.
