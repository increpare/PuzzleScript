The error messages indicate that the parser is expecting a color code for each object, but it encounters something unexpected due to format issues. It seems the spacing in the `objects` section is causing these errors. PuzzleScript expects specific formatting where each line in the `objects` section allows for clear delineation between the object name, character representation, and color. Let's correct this by ensuring consistent spacing and alignment.

Here's the plan:
1. Ensure there are two spaces separating each part (name, character, color) in the `objects` section, which is the typical PuzzleScript format.
2. Verify that every object has a unique character associated with it and that there are no duplicates.
3. Ensure colors are correctly specified as a six-digit hexadecimal value.

Below is the corrected version of the code:

The formatting adjustments in the `objects` section should correct the parsing errors, allowing the game to compile and work as intended.
