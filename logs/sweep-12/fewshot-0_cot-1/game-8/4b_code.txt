The errors mentioned indicate that the editor was expecting color codes for each object after their names in the "objects" section, but failed to find them. The likely cause is a formatting issue, specifically that the heading and the list of objects seem improperly separated. Let's examine the correct format:

1. Ensure that each object definition in the "objects" section starts on a new line and contains a valid color code.
2. Verify other sections for correct syntax.

Let's correct the formatting by ensuring proper line breaks and alignment. Here's the corrected code:

This should resolve the errors by fixing any formatting inconsistencies, ensuring that each object has its color and character specification clearly defined on a single line.
