The console output indicates errors in parsing the objects section of the PuzzleScript code. Specifically, the format for defining objects seems incorrect. In PuzzleScript, each object definition should consist of an object name, a character for representation, and a color code. The issue here may be due to formatting errors or misalignment that causes errors during parsing.

Let's format each object definition properly. We need to ensure that each line contains exactly these three elements: object name, character representation, and color code without extra spaces. 

Here's the repaired version of the code:

In this revised version, each object has a properly formatted definition with consistent spacing, fixing the parsing errors mentioned in the output. Additionally, I've added a color for BoxOnTarget, missing in the erroneous section.
