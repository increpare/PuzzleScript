The given PuzzleScript code is producing errors due to syntax issues and incorrect object definitions. Let's address these issues one by one:

1. **Duplicate Definitions**: The symbols for Player ("P"), BlockOnTarget ("O"), and Target (".") are conflicting or defined incorrectly across objects and the legend. We must ensure symbols used in objects, legends, and maps are consistent.

2. **Sprite Dimensions**: In PuzzleScript, all sprite graphics must be 5x5 characters. We need to correct the object definitions accordingly.

3. **Missing Colors**: Some object colors were not specified properly. We'll specify colors where they are noted as missing.

4. **Mapping Symbols Consistency**: The "." for Target is used as a background and symbol causing conflicts. We need to have proper differentiation among the elements used in the legend and map.

5. **Collision Layers**: Ensure all objects are correctly included within collision layers.

6. **Legend Definitions**: Ensure all symbols used in the levels match definitions in the legend.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

### Key Fixes

- **Object Definitions**: Each object now has an explicit 5x5 representation.
- **Target Symbol**: Changed symbol for Target from "." to "T" to avoid clashing with the background. The maps have been updated accordingly.
- **Legend**: Updated to reflect the new symbol for Target and to ensure all objects are defined.
- **Levels**: Updated to match the legend by using the new "T" symbol for Target.

This should correct the errors and allow the game to compile and run as intended.
