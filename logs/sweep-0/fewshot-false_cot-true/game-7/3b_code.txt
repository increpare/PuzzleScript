To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, we need to correct a few key issues:

1. **MetaData errors**: Ensure that the title and author metadata entries have values. The metadata values should follow directly after the metadata header without a line, so the parts labelled `title` and `author` need values specified immediately after them.

2. **Sprite matrix issues**: Sprites are defined in a grid-like manner. Here, the `Player` and `Block` objects have their sprite definition incorrectly formatted — they must conform to a specific height and width. In this setup, a 3x3 matrix was attempted, but misaligned. For legibility, let’s switch to one character per pixel for simplicity.

3. **Potential issues with rules and layouts**: Ensure rules and level contents are correctly using defined symbols.

Here is how the corrected script should look:

```

The key changes include:
- Adding direct values under `title` and `author` headers.
- Consistently format sprites using a single character per pixel for clarity, ensuring alignment per object.
- I added some descriptions within spaces in the sprite matrices to conform to strict positioning without leaving out undetermined space, aligning visual correct form on each item.
