The console output indicates that there are "Unknown junk" errors in the sprite matrix definitions for the objects Player and Block. This likely means there are issues with the way the sprite patterns are defined. Each sprite definition should be a 5x5 matrix composed of characters (usually spaces and periods to denote transparency), and the same character should be used in all columns of a row if it represents a single color. Examining the code, the Player's and Block's sprites are not formatted correctly. Let's correct these by making sure they adhere to the typical 5x5 grid pattern syntax.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

```

In this version, I've ensured that all sprite matrices are correctly defined as 5x5 grids with appropriate whitespace for any empty spaces. Now, the Player and Block objects are correctly formatted, resolving the compilation errors. This code should compile without errors.
