To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we'll need to cover several key components within the PuzzleScript language. These components include:

1. **Objects**: Define the visual representations of different entities in the game.
2. **Legend**: Connect objects to easily referable characters or names.
3. **Sound**: Optional but can add an extra layer of feedback (skipped for simplicity).
4. **Collision Layers**: Determine the interaction between objects by defining which can overlap.
5. **Rules**: Set the behavior and interactions of objects each turn.
6. **Win Conditions**: Specify what conditions must be met to win a level.
7. **Levels**: Design the actual layout or puzzles of the game.

### Game Concept
Let's create a simple game with the following idea:
- The player controls a character that pushes blocks to targets.
- Once all blocks are on targets, the player wins.
- This concept is akin to a simple Sokoban-type game.

### Game Components

- **Objects**: Player, Wall, Block, Target
- **Rules**: Player can move in four directions, can push blocks.
- **Win Condition**: All blocks are on targets.
- **Levels**: Include a simple starting level with walls, blocks, and targets.

### Explanation
- **Objects**: Defined visual representations for the player, wall, block, target, and block on target.
- **Legend**: Links single characters (P, #, B, T, O) to respective objects.
- **Collision Layers**: Specifies the layer hierarchy and indicates that "Player" and "Block" occupy the same layer which allows for interaction.
- **Rules**:
  - Players can push blocks.
  - Blocks become 'BlockOnTarget' when pushed onto targets.
- **Win Conditions**: You win when all blocks are on targets.
- **Levels**: Basic level layout for initial puzzle-solving experience.

This simple game captures the essence of Sokoban-style gameplay using PuzzleScript language. You can expand it by adding more complex levels and interactions (like multiple players, undo functionality, etc.).
