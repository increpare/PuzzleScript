To address the errors present in the given PuzzleScript code, we should:

1. **Resolve Name Collisions:** The `legend` section re-uses the same symbols defined in the `objects` section. The legend should not use object symbols but should instead assign symbols or alias for constructing game patterns. Specifically, change aliases in the legend to avoid conflicts.

2. **Ordering and Missing Sections:** Add missing sections like `sounds` and reorder sections properly according to PuzzleScript requirements.

3. **Correct Naming Conventions in Rules:** The rules section refers to lowercase `player` and `block`, while they are declared with capitalized names (`Player` and `Block`). Adjust these terms to match exact object names.

4. **Win Condition Mistake:** Correct the win condition to reflect your intended logic. Ensure that it matches the objects correctly defined.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

Here's what was done:
- `legend` has been adjusted to use unused symbols for its legends.
- `sounds` section was added, though it's empty, to fit documentation requirements.
- Adjusted `rules` to capitalize `Player` and `Block`, corresponding to the defined objects.
- Win conditions remained the same, as logic seems correct for the game's purpose, but ensure it matches intended gameplay (all blocks need to be on targets to win).
