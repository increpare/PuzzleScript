To create a complete PuzzleScript game, the process involves several key steps:

1. **Define Objects**: Establish the entities involved in the game. These typically include the player, targets, walls, and any other interactive elements.

2. **Create Legend**: Establish shorthand legends for these objects, facilitating simpler and more readable level design.

3. **Design Collision Layers**: Specify which objects can interact with each other, to manage game physics and interactions correctly.

4. **Implement Rules**: Define how the game behaves when certain conditions are met, using rules for interaction and movement.

5. **Set Up Win Conditions**: Define the objectives and conditions under which the game will be considered won.

6. **Design Levels**: Construct levels that will serve as challenges using the objects and rules defined earlier.

7. **Add Metadata**: Provide game information like the author and title for better identification and tracking.

For this example, let's create a simple Sokoban-like puzzle game, where the player pushes boxes onto target spots.

Here's the complete PuzzleScript code:

### Explanation:

- **Objects**: We have a player (`P`), wall (`#`), crate (`C`), target (`X`), and a combined state (`O`) representing a crate on a target.
  
- **Legend**: Simplifies level creation by mapping characters to objects.

- **Collision Layers**: Define which objects can move over or with each other. The player and crate interact, but walls block movement.

- **Rules**: Dictate that the player can push crates and that a crate on a target becomes a `CrateTarget`.

- **Win Conditions**: The game is won when all crates (`C`) are on targets (`X`), converting to `CrateTarget` (`O`).

- **Levels**: Two example levels are provided to demonstrate the mechanics. The layout uses the legend to build the environment.

This code provides a complete and functional PuzzleScript game, exemplifying the classic mechanics of Sokoban. You can expand upon this by creating new levels or adding more complex rules and objects.
