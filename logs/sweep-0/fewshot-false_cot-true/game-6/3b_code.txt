The error messages you're receiving indicate there are issues with the `colors` section of the code. The game is expecting each object declared in the `objects` section to have an associated color defined in the `colors` section. The compiler seems to be trying to match each object to a corresponding color but is unable to do so with the current list of colors provided.

Let's fix this by ensuring each object has a color associated with it. We need to check the names and make sure they match exactly with the objects' names as declared in the `objects` section. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

In this revised code, I went through the `colors` section to ensure that each object has a unique color associated with it, and I confirmed that each name matches the corresponding name declared under `objects`. This should address the compiler errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
