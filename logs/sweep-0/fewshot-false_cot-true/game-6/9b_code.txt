The errors reported by the console indicate that the issue is likely with how the colors are being defined or interpreted in the "colors" section. In PuzzleScript, each declared object from the "objects" section needs to have a corresponding color in the "colors" section. However, according to the error messages, the system is unable to match the color declarations correctly with the objects.

Upon inspecting the "colors" section, it seems suitable given the object names and their associated colors. However, it can be clarified by explicitly defining the case sensitivity and ensuring there's a clear mapping without any confusion.

Let's proceed with the following plan:
1. Ensure each object name in the "objects" section exactly matches the corresponding color definition in the "colors" section including case sensitivity.
2. Properly define each object with a unique color.

Here's a revised version of the code with the necessary corrections:

```

This version of the code ensures clarity and correct association between objects and their visual representation within the game. The colors should now map correctly to the respective objects, eliminating the errors encountered during compilation.
