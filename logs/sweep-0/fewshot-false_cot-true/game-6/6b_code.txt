The errors in the console output indicate that the game is having issues parsing the lines in the `colors` section. Specifically, the issue is that the object names are not correctly matched with their colors due to indentation inconsistencies. PuzzleScript expects a strict layout, and each line in the `colors` section needs to have the object name and color correctly matched without extra spaces.

Here are the steps to fix the game code:

1. Review each line in the `colors` section and ensure that each line properly matches the object name with its respective color.
2. Eliminate any discrepancies in spaces or misaligned attributes.
3. Correct any malformed syntax according to PuzzleScript expectations.

Let's rewrite the `colors` section to ensure that the objects are correctly matched with their colors.

This updated code should now compile without errors related to the `colors` section. All object names should align directly with their assigned colors, which matches the puzzle script specification for defining colors.
