The errors in the provided code are due to the mismatch between the object names used in the `objects` section and the alias definitions in the `legend` section. In the `colors` section, the provided code attempts to define colors for objects using their incorrect names instead of their legend aliases. Let's fix these errors by ensuring that each object name specified in the `colors` section matches what is declared in the `legend` section.

Here's the corrected game code:

### Changes Made:

1. Replaced the names in the `colors` section with their respective legend aliases. This addresses the parsing errors encountered in the original code:
   - Changed `Background` to `.`
   - Changed `Wall` to `#`
   - Changed `Player` to `P`
   - Changed `Crate` to `C`
   - Changed `Target` to `X`
   - Changed `CrateTarget` to `O`
