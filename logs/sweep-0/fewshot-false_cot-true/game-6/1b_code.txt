The errors in the console output are related to the incorrect parsing of the `colors` section in the PuzzleScript code. This happens because the colors are not properly linked due to the way the `colors` section is structured. In PuzzleScript, it's important to have one object per line followed by its color. The correct syntax requires each object to be assigned a color on a separate line without misalignment or missing objects.

Here's the plan to fix the errors:
1. Ensure that each object in the `objects` section has a corresponding color defined in the `colors` section.
2. Align the object definitions and color assignments properly, with one object per line.

Considering these points, here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code:

```

With the corrections made in the `colors` and overall formatting, the code should now compile correctly without errors.
