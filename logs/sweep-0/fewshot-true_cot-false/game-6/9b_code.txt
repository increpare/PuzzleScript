I have reviewed the puzzle levels, and to ensure solvability, I will make the following changes:

1. **Level 1**: Move the Goal to a position where the Connector can be pushed onto it by the Player.
2. **Level 3**: Adjust wall positions and ensure pathways to allow the Player to push the Connector to the Goal.

Here's the revised version of the game:

These changes ensure that it's possible for the Player to push the Connector to the Goal in each provided level.
