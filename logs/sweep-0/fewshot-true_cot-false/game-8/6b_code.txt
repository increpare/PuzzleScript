Here is the repaired version of your PuzzleScript game code. I have removed the unexpected sound token and fixed the syntax issues in the rules.

Changes made:
- Removed the `move 12345` sound token as it caused an error and was not essential to the basic game functionality.
- Adjusted the rule `[ > Player | no Wall ] -> [ > Player | ]` to remove an unnecessary space.
- Corrected the rule `[ Player on Target ] -> win` to `[ Player Target ] -> win` for proper syntax.

Please test the game to ensure it works as expected.
