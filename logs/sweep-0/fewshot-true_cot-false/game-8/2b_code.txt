Certainly! The errors in your code are related to incorrect color index references in the artwork you specified for the `Wall` and `Player` objects. I've corrected these issues by properly defining the colors for each object's artwork. Here's the revised code:

Here's what I've done to address the errors:

- Defined a color palette for the `Player` sprite by using two colors: `yellow` and `black`.
- The color reference numbers in the sprite patterns correctly correspond to the defined palette.

This should resolve the compilation errors you were encountering.
