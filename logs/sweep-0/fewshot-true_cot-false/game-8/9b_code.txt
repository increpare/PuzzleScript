Note: The errors were due to the `[ > Player | no Wall ] -> [ > Player ]` line where the right side of the rule was incomplete when compared to the left side. Additionally, since PuzzleScript treats each pattern on the left side as a unit, they must match the right side in length. Using `[ > Player | no Wall ] -> [ > Player | Background ]` corrects this by ensuring the rule has a matching set of components on both sides.
