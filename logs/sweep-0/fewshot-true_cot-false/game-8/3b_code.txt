Here's the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've resolved the issues with the color palettes for the `Wall` and `Player` objects:

Adjustments made:
- Updated `Wall` to have only one color in its palette and made sure the pattern utilizes this single color.
- Updated `Player` to use only colors 0 and 1, making sure the design uses these index numbers correctly to avoid accessing undefined colors.
