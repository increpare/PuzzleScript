It looks like the `Wall` and `Target` objects have been defined with a single color, but they are trying to use multiple colors in their sprites. Let's adjust the definitions to ensure all necessary colors are specified. Here's the corrected code:

I added more colors to the `Wall` and `Target` objects to fit the specified sprites. This should resolve the accessibility and formatting errors you encountered.
