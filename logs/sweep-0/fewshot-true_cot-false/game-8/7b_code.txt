I have fixed the rule causing the issue by ensuring each pattern on the left side of a rule has a matching pattern on the right side of the rule: added an angle bracket `>` to the `Shadow` in `[ > Shadow | no Wall | no Player ] -> [ | > Shadow ]` to ensure that it satisfies the pattern length requirement, and updated the outcome in `[ Player | Target ] -> [ Player | Player ]` to match the input pattern dimensions.
