Certainly! The errors in your code are related to color palette definitions for the `Wall` and `Target` objects. The current definitions incorrectly assume multiple colors in a single color row. To fix this, I've made changes to ensure each object has the proper color values. Here's the corrected version:

Make sure that each object only has one color row per color used, as shown above. This should resolve the errors related to incorrect color palette access.
