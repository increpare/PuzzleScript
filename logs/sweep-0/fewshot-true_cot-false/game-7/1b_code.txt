Here is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript code. I've addressed the errors pertaining to color palette references for the Wall and Target objects.

I've replaced references to undefined color indices with direct references to the colors defined for the `Wall` and `Target`. Also, I've corrected the sprite color palette errors for the Wall and Target objects and aligned sound identifiers in the rules section with the sound identifiers declared under the SOUNDS section.
