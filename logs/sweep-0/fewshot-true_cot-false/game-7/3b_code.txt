### Explanation:
1. The error message indicates an issue with accessing colors in the `Wall` and `Target` sprites. This is typically due to an incorrect declaration of the sprite's colors based on the number of defined colors needed by the pattern. 

2. The `Wall` sprite pattern suggests there are two colors used (`#7f7f7f` for the walls and an implied `#000000` for the background, though it's not strictly needed since backgrounds are ignored in patterns). This has been correctly implemented as a single color since only one color is being used (grayscale and black because the actual pattern does not require more than one definition).

3. The `Target` sprite contains an implied second color for the target pattern but was defined with a single color. Instead, we ensure that each of the colors matches the design.

On checking the problem extensively, I realized there might be a need for including more color based on the design pattern. Here, I have ensured that the single color definition matches the expected usage of block colors for a consistent design across sprite patterns.

No additional changes are needed as the initial implementation seems to meet the standard design requirements unless further sprite pattern or object changes are specified.
