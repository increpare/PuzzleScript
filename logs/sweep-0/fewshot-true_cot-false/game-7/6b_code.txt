The errors in the code are primarily due to missing sections and incorrect naming conventions in the RULES section. Here's the corrected version of the PuzzleScript game code:

### Changes Made:
- Added a `SOUNDS` section as it was missing, which caused an error.
- Corrected the case sensitivity in the `RULES` section. PuzzleScript is case-sensitive, so make sure object names match exactly as they are defined.
- In the RULES section, fixed the use of `> Player` and `> Cube` to ensure they move correctly.
- Changed "no Obstacle" to "not Obstacle" as per PuzzleScript's syntax requirement for negation.
- Removed an unnecessary empty space in the second rule for correct syntax.
