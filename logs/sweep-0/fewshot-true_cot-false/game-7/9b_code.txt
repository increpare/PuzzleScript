### Explanation
1. **Level 0**:
    - Rearranged the level to make it solvable. The initial configuration placed the cube away from the target with no way to move it there. Now, the target is accessible via a clear path.

2. **Sound Effect**: Added a sound effect (`sfx0`) for when the player moves a cube onto a target for feedback, which isn't necessary for solvability but enhances the game experience.

3. **Code Structure**: Ensured all top-level elements, objects, rules, etc., are properly defined and used.

By adjusting the level design, I ensured that each cube has a clear path to its target, making the levels solvable.
