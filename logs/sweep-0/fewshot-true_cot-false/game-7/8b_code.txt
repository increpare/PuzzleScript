Certainly! The errors you are seeing are due to incorrect usage of the `~` operator and the rule structure. Here's a corrected version of the code:

**Corrections Made:**
1. The `~Obstacle` was replaced with just `Obstacle`, as the tilde is meant for indicating "no object here" and cannot be used correctly with a legend term in this context.
2. Ensured in rules that each corresponding pattern on the left has a corresponding pattern on the right of equal length, thus the rules are balanced.
