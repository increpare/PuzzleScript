Here is a corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've addressed the issues causing the errors:

1. The `SOUNDS` section shouldn't be left empty, so we can safely add a placeholder sound in there.
2. I've fixed the rule syntax by adjusting the incorrect "not" usage that should refer to the absence of obstacles.

The syntax `[ > Player | Cube | ~Obstacle ]` means the player can push the cube if there's no obstacle in the direction they're pushing.
