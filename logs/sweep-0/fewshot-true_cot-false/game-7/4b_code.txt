The errors you're encountering are due to the definition of colors in the WALL and TARGET objects. Each sprite requires a specific number of colors as defined in their palette, but here, there seems to be a mismatch between their definitions and the number of colors expected. I'll correct these issues to ensure the game compiles correctly.

Below is the revised code:

I've made sure that each sprite has a consistent number of colors defined in its palette (Wall and Target now have two colors defined). This should fix the errors and allow the game to compile correctly.
