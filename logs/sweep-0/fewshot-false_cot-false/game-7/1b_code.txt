It seems there are several issues with the original code. Let's address them:

1. The section `SOUNDS` does not exist in PuzzleScript.
2. The `message` command is used improperly. In PuzzleScript, messages are written in level comments.
3. The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is missing, which is required in the code structure.
4. Certain rules are incorrect or missing logic.

Below is a revised version of the code with these issues fixed:

Changes made:
1. Removed the non-existent `SOUNDS` section since PuzzleScript does not support direct sound assignment.
2. Adjusted structure to include the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section.
3. Used basic rules for `CrateOnTarget` that automatically transition to a win condition. The `win` condition now checks when all crates are on all targets.
4. Removed incorrect use of `PUSH` and `NO-MOVE` rules.
