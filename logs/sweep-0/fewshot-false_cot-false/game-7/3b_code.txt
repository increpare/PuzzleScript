```

### Fixes made:

1. **Rearranged the Sections**: Added a `WINCONDITIONS` section to follow the expected order. PuzzleScript requires that `WINCONDITIONS` must precede `LEVELS`. Even if there are no win conditions other than the default, you should include the section header.

2. **Level Data Correction**: Removed accidental spaces and aligned the level map properly to ensure consistency. Spaces and unintended characters can cause errors on those lines.

3. **Corrected Comments Format**: Ensure comment lines (like for Level 1 and Level 2) are properly named and do not introduce any unknown characters.

By addressing these errors, the game should compile successfully. Adjust the win conditions section if you need any custom conditions beyond the default winning rules.
