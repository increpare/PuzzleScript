This game includes:
- Basic game objects: Player, Crate, Target, Wall, and CrateOnTarget.
- Simple rules to allow the player to push crates.
- A sound for pushing crates and a victory message when the player wins by placing all crates on targets.
- Two levels to illustrate the gameplay mechanics.

You can expand this by adding more levels or increasing complexity through additional mechanics and objects.
