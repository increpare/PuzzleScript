Certainly! Below is the corrected version of the code for your Simple Sokoban game. I've addressed all the issues mentioned in the console output.

### Changes Made:
1. Moved the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to follow the `SOUNDS` section.
2. Added a `SOUNDS` section to the script to follow the required ordering of sections.
3. Corrected object rule references (`Player` and `Crate`) to their defined legend names (`P` and `B`).

These changes should resolve the compilation errors you were encountering.
