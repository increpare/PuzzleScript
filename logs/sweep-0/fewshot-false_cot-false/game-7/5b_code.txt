### Changes Made:
1. **Objects Section**: No changes were needed.
2. **Legend Section**: No changes were needed.
3. **CollisionLayers Section**: Changed the separator from `==========` to `================` to maintain consistency.
4. **Rules Section**: Adjusted the rule for crate and target: 
   - `[ B | T ] -> [ O | T ]` ensures that a crate on a target turns into a CrateOnTarget and maintains the target underneath.
   - `[ O | T ] -> [ O | T ]` maintains the state as is with CrateOnTarget over the Target.
5. **WinConditions Section**: Added `All O on T` to properly define the win condition.
6. **Levels Section**: Removed the `// Level 1` and `// Level 2` comments to fix errors related to undefined keys. These weren't needed as PuzzleScript doesn't require labels like `Level 1` for level definition.

These adjustments should fix the compilation errors and make the game run as intended.
