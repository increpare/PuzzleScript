### Fixes Made:
1. **Line 58**: Adjusted the "COLLISIONLAYERS" section so that no extra equals signs are on the same line with a comment.
2. **Line 8**: Fixed the dimensions of the `Background` sprite to be exactly 5x5.
3. **Line 101 & Line 108**: Defined the space ' ' symbol in levels by adding an entry for `Background` to the legend to resolve unknown symbol errors in maps.
