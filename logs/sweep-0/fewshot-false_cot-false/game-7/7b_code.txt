Below is the corrected version of your PuzzleScript game code. I've ensured that the sprite graphics are all 5x5, removed comments after equals signs, made sure levels are rectangular, and fixed errors related to undefined symbols.

### Summary of Changes:
- Each sprite graphic is defined as a 5x5 grid.
- Removed comments after the `SOUNDS` section and made it truly empty since `====` indicates sections that should not have content other than comments.
- Rectified the levels so that they're rectangles by ensuring each level's rows are the same length.
- Replaced undefined symbols with spaces within the levels to avoid missing symbols.
