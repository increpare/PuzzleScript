### Key Changes Made:
1. **Sprite Size Fix**: Ensured that each object's sprite graphic is 5x5 as required by PuzzleScript.
2. **Rectangular Level Definition**: Fixed the levels to ensure each row has the same length.
3. **Whitespace Symbol Error**: Identified spaces between objects in the map were causing errors for being unrecognized. Corrected the map syntax to ensure the spaces are handled correctly as part of valid characters or added an explicit `Background` representation where required.
