Changes made:
1. Added an empty `SOUNDS` section, as it was previously missing.
2. Fixed the case sensitivity issue by ensuring consistent use of object names with initial uppercase letters in `COLLISIONLAYERS` and `RULES`. The terms `Player` and `Crate` should be capitalized in the `RULES` section to match their definitions in the `OBJECTS` section. 
3. Verified that there are no erroneous lines after the line of equality signs (e.g., `========`) other than the specified section heading.
