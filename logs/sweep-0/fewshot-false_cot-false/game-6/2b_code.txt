### Summary of Changes:
1. Corrected the `homepage` line to include a URL format (`http://game.com`).
2. Added colors to the `objects` section to align with PuzzleScript requirements: `Empty`, `Player`, `Wall`, `Floor`, `Block`, and `Destination` now each have an associated color.
3. Adjusted the `collisionlayers` to separate `Player, Block` and `Wall, Floor, Destination` to ensure proper interaction.
4. Ensured consistent syntax in rule definitions with appropriate spacing.
