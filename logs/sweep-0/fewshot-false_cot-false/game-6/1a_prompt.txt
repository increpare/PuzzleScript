produced the following console output:
=================================
line 6 : MetaData "homepage" needs a value.
line 7 : Unrecognised stuff in the prelude.
line 10 : section "LEGEND" is out of order, must follow  "OBJECTS" (or it could be that the section "OBJECTS"is just missing totally.  You have to include all section headings, even if the section itself is empty).
line 11 : You're talking about EMPTY but it's not defined anywhere.
line 12 : You're talking about PLAYER but it's not defined anywhere.
line 13 : You're talking about WALL but it's not defined anywhere.
