### Notes on Fixes:
1. **Error with `homepage` metadata**: Correct URL provided after `homepage` without any additional lines or symbols.
   
2. **Objects Section**: The error messages suggest there was a misalignment or missing entries due to incorrect object definitions. These are corrected with appropriate syntax ensuring each object color has its unique line and unique color.
  
3. **Additional Issues and Corrections**:
   - Ensured each entity is correctly mapped to an object name and color in the "objects" section without the reuse of an already defined entity "=".
   - The `sounds` section error was due to the incorrect line following the "sounds" header. It has been corrected to represent a proper sound declaration. There is just one sound type mentioned (fanfare). Therefore, I maintained succinct keyword branches.
   - The overall structure remained consistent with expectations for sections and section delimiters (e.g., empty lines didn’t precede or follow headers unnecessarily). 
   
By addressing the metadata and definition issues, the code is aligned with the syntax the parser expects, and should be free of compilation errors.
