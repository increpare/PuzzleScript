Sure, I can help with that. It seems like there are several issues with spacing and formatting that need to be addressed for correct compilation. Here's the repaired version of your code:

I adjusted the issues with object colors by properly assigning them using the `object color` format without the `=` symbol. Now, your code should be free of those initial errors.
