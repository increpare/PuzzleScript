Key fixes:
- Added an `objects` section to define all game elements such as `Empty`, `Player`, `Wall`, `Floor`, `Block`, and `Destination`.
- Ensured that the `objects` section is defined before the `legend` section.
- Replaced `Crate` with `Block` in the rules and winconditions to match the defining name in the `objects` section.
