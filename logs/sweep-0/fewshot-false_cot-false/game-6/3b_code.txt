Here are the key corrections made:

1. **Homepage metadata:** Ensured the "homepage" metadata link was complete.
2. **Objects section:** Added a `background` placeholder to clarify object layers and altered object initialization for clarity.
3. **Legend section and collision layers:** Added background to support game visualization.
4. **Resolved Parsing Errors:** Adapted formatting for consistency with standard conventions.

These updates should eliminate the compilation errors and assist you in running the game correctly.
