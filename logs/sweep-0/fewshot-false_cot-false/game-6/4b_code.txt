### Key Changes:
1. **Corrected Metadata for Homepage**: Added a valid URL inside the homepage section.
2. **Fixed Object Definitions**: Standardized object color and definition for 'background' and other objects.
3. **Corrected Collision Layers**: Ensured the proper use of object names with lowercase to match those you defined in the objects section.
