### Key Corrections:
- Removed extra spaces between object names and the `=` sign in the **objects** section.
- Ensured that each line specifying an object color uses a unique object name.
- MetaData "homepage" was already correctly included; the error may have been prompted by incorrect parsing due to additional spaces.
- Ensured that the **legend** section is properly aligned with single spaces between symbols and object names for consistency.
