Changes made:
1. Fixed the unnecessary declaration of `background` and `empty` objects with repeated color assignment.
2. Removed incorrectly thrown errors by ensuring that each object is properly declared with just its color after the equality sign.
3. Specified each object's color correctly following PuzzleScript syntax rules.
4. Removed duplicate definitions in the `objects` section, ensuring clarity.
