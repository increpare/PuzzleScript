To address the errors in your PuzzleScript game code, I made the following changes:

1. Corrected the sound commands by changing "PUSH" and "FAIL" to accepted sound verbs.
2. Fixed the rule causing a mismatched pattern by ensuring input and output patterns have the same width.
3. Made sure all levels are rectangular, having consistent row lengths.

Here is the revised code:

These changes should resolve the errors and allow your game to function correctly.
