The reported issue suggests that the game levels might be unsolvable due to initial placement of crates and targets, or possibly incorrect rule configurations. In Sokoban, each crate must be pushed onto a target, so the initial setup should allow this to happen. Here's a possible correction in the code to ensure the levels are solvable:

Changes were made to the levels to ensure that crates can be successfully pushed onto targets:

- **Level 0**: Rearranged positions so that there is an adequate path for the player to push the crate onto a target.
- **Level 1**: Adjusted crate and player positions to create a solvable sequence where crates can be pushed onto the target positions.

These changes should make both levels solvable while maintaining the basic gameplay mechanics of Sokoban.
