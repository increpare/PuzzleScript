Certainly! Let's address the issues found in your PuzzleScript code:

1. The player sprite matrix contains `...` before and after the sprite definition `..g .g. ...`. These need to be removed since they aren't valid in the OBJECTS section for defining the player sprite.

2. There is a mistake in the SOUNDS section where sound effects are not correctly defined using the necessary verbs. We'll replace these with standard PuzzleScript sound effects like `move` and `cantmove`.

Here's the corrected code:

These changes should address the compilation errors and allow the game to function as expected.
