### Explanation of Corrections:

1. **Sprite Dimensions for Player**: The sprite matrix for the Player object previously had an incorrect format (`..g`, `.g.`, `...`) implying dimensions of 3x3 but written incorrectly. Adjusted these to have a consistent 3x3 matrix (`"..g..", ".g...", "....."`).

2. **Sound Definitions**: There were unknown entries within the `SOUNDS` section. After reviewing, the original listings suffice (`move 70`, `cantmove 90`). Check these actions based on context in the PuzzleScript engine; generally, sounds should directly relate to actions if supported by the tool.

The rest of the code looked syntactically correct based on PuzzleScript conventions and needed no structural adjustments.
