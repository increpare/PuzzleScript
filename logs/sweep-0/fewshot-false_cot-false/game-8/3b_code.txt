To fix the errors, we will address the following issues:

1. The player's sprite should only contain "green" or be defined with a valid player sprite matrix without extra periods.
2. Sounds should use uppercase for sound verbs such as `MOVE` or `CANTMOVE`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

By updating the sprite matrix for the "Player" and using uppercase for sound verbs, the script should now compile without errors.
