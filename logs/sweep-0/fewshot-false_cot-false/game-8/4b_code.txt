Here is a revised version of your PuzzleScript game code. I addressed several issues, including sound specification errors, rules syntax errors, and level formatting.

Here's a summary of what was done:
1. Fixed the sound verbs in the SOUNDS section. Changed "MOVE" and "CANTMOVE" to "PUSH" and "FAIL", respectively, because "MOVE" and "CANTMOVE" are invalid sound types in PuzzleScript.
2. Modified the failing rule `[Player | Wall] -> [Player | Wall]` to make it valid. In PuzzleScript, the failure condition is usually handled by not allowing any movement when a player tries to walk into a wall.
3. Ensured levels were correctly formatted as rectangles by ensuring each row has the same length.
