This game defines a few different objects: `Player`, `Wall`, `Crate`, `Target`, and `CrateOnTarget`. The objective of this simple game is to push all crates onto targets. The levels are constructed within the `LEVELS` section. The `RULES` section defines the game mechanics, like moving crates and handling crate-on-target logic. The `WINCONDITIONS` section is used to determine when the game is won, which occurs when all crates are on targets.
