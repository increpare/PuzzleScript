To repair the issues mentioned in the console output, we need to correct the color handling for the `Player` and `Wall` objects in the game. The errors indicate that the game is trying to access non-existent color values from the color palette for these objects. Here's a plan of action:

1. **Fix Player Object's Colors:**
   - The `Player` object has a palette that is missing colors. The code expects multiple colors to render the player sprite pattern.
   - Ensure the `Player` has at least four colors, as there are indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 referenced in the sprite pattern.

2. **Fix Wall Object's Colors:**
   - The `Wall` object should have color indices that match its pattern's expectation. Assign a suitable grey color to be used in each index.

3. **Ensure Consistent Color Palette:**
   - Validate that each object with a defined pattern uses a color palette that has enough entries to match the highest index used in the pattern.

With this in mind, here is the corrected version of the code:

```

The corrections involve:
- Adding additional colors to the `Player` object using yellow, white, light grey, and orange to match the palette indices used by the sprite pattern.
- Assigning varying shades of grey to the `Wall` object to satisfy its pattern's color indices.
These changes address the color palette issues as outlined in the error messages.
