To address the errors in the provided PuzzleScript game code, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Block Color Error**: The error messages indicate that the `Block` sprite is trying to reference multiple colors, but only one color is defined. To fix this, we need to specify additional colors that the sprite demands.

2. **Section Order Error**: The `COLLISIONLAYERS` section is out of order. We need to insert an empty `SOUNDS` section before it to maintain the appropriate sequence of PuzzleScript sections.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Block Color**: The `Block` sprite now uses three colors (orange, brown, and darkorange) to address the error related to multiple colors being referenced but only one color being defined.
  
- **Section Order**: An empty `SOUNDS` section was added to ensure that the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section follows the correct order. This resolves the ordering error.

This should compile without errors and run as intended.
