To address the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, let's analyze the problem:

1. **Color Specification Error**: The error message indicates that the color "darkorange" is not defined or is being incorrectly accessed in the `Block` object definition. When defining the colors for an object, you must ensure that the number of colors used in the sprite matches the number of colors declared in the header. Each color in the header corresponds to a digit in the sprite.

2. **Fixing the Block Object**:
   - The `Block` object declares three colors: orange, brown, and darkorange. However, the errors indicate a mismatch between these declared colors and the colors used in the sprite (which expects a minimum of three distinct colors defined in the sprite grid that match the declared color count).
   - The sprite uses the digit `2`, but based on the error (referencing color index `2` which doesn't exist in a 2-color palette), the color usages are incorrectly defined.

**Plan of Action**:
- First, ensure that color definitions for `Block` are correctly mapped and are consistent with their usage in the sprite grid.
- Verify the number of colors defined matches their usage in the sprite.

Here is the corrected code ensuring that the `Block` object has three distinct colors with matching sprite usage:

### Explanation:
- The `Block` sprite was using a single digit (`2`) originally intending three separate layers, but due to improper color specification, it was causing errors. I simplified it to just use two distinct colors: `orange` and `brown` as represented by `1` and `0` respectively, ensuring that the access index matches and there's no mismatch.
  
The corrected code should compile without errors, thereby fixing the previously mentioned issues.
