Changes made:
- Moved the Player in Level 0 so there's an open path from the starting position to push the Block and exit.
- Level 1 had the Player trapped. Adjusted the starting configuration to allow navigation and block movement toward the Exit. 

These changes ensure the Player can push the Block toward the Exit and complete each level.
