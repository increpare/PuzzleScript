In this corrected version for Level 0, I adjusted the positions of the Block and Exit to ensure that the Player can push the Block to create a path to the Exit. Similarly, Level 1 was modified to make sure that the Player can navigate around the Obstacles to reach the Exit using Block pushing strategically.
