To create a complete PuzzleScript game, we need to consider several components: the game's title, objects, rules, and levels. Our goal is to create a simple yet engaging game. We'll design a game called "Maze Escape," where the player must navigate a maze and push blocks to reach the exit.

**Plan:**

1. **Define the Title and Metadata**: Set the game's name and author.

2. **Define the Objects**: We'll have a Player, Wall, Floor, Block (pushable), and Exit.

3. **Set the Legend**: Map characters to the objects for use in levels.

4. **Set Up Collision Layers**: Specify the layers to organize object interactions.

5. **Write the Rules**: Define the interaction, mainly pushing blocks.

6. **Set Win Conditions**: Win when the player reaches the exit.

7. **Create Levels**: Define at least two levels with increasing difficulty.

Below is the complete PuzzleScript game code:

**Explanation of Components:**

- **Objects**: Six objects are defined: Background (default), Player, Wall, Floor, Block, and Exit. Each object has a specific color and design.

- **Legend**: Maps simple characters to the game objects for easy level design.

- **Collision Layers**: Defines how different objects interact with each other and within the game. Layers are ordered from Background to Exit.

- **Rules**: Controls game logic, primarily pushing the Block when it's adjacent to the Player and the Player moves toward it.

- **Win Conditions**: Specifies that the player wins when they stand on the Exit.

- **Levels**: Two levels are crafted to provide challenges. The player (P) needs to push the block (B) to navigate the maze and reach the exit (E).

This design emphasizes a straightforward puzzle concept, making it accessible and engaging for players of all ages.
