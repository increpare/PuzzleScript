Upon reviewing the provided PuzzleScript game code, the errors mentioned in the console output relate to the level definitions and their headers. Specifically, the errors point out that "L", "V", "1", and "2" are not defined in the legend, which is likely due to the level headers being misinterpreted as part of the level map itself. Additionally, the code indicates that the game is expecting these headers to fulfill some legend requirement, which doesn't exist, and that the levels are not rectangular because of these headers.

To resolve these issues, we should remove the level headers and ensure that the levels are defined correctly and consistently without any additional text. The PuzzleScript engine can’t interpret header comments inside the LEVELS section, so it treats them as if they are part of the level layout, causing those errors.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

This revised code removes the headers for each level ("# Level 1" and "# Level 2") that were being misinterpreted as part of the actual level design. With this correction, the levels should compile correctly and adhere to the rectangular requirement.
