To resolve the errors mentioned, it's important to understand that PuzzleScript expects certain symbols in the legend to correctly interpret the content of the levels. The errors indicate that the game is trying to interpret characters like "L", "V", "1", and "2" because these appear in the level definitions as identifiers for level numbers and comments, but there's no explicit mechanism within this game to capture these as comments.

To fix the issue, I will:

1. Remove the lined portion of level descriptions that is causing confusion.
2. Use comments appropriately to describe levels, outside the level description lines.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

Explanation:
- Removed the numerical symbols associated with the levels in the original submission, which PuzzleScript was likely interpreting as objects due to the prototype symbols not being defined in the `LEGEND`.
- Preserved the level structure as it originally utilized consistent game symbols.
- Commented level descriptions outside the level grid, making it clear they are not part of the game grid itself.

This revised version ensures symbols are used correctly and ensures level comments do not interfere with the level parsing logic.
