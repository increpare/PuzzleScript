To create a complete PuzzleScript game, I will need to define several sections such as the title, author, objects, legend, collision layers, rules, and levels. The game should have a simple and clear objective to ensure it's engaging and understandable. Let's design a basic game where the player must navigate a maze, collect all keys, and reach the exit.

**Game Plan:**

1. **Title and Metadata**: Define the game's title and author name.
2. **Objects**: Define graphics and colors for Background, Player, Wall, Key, and Exit.
3. **Legend**: Assign simple characters or symbols to represent different objects.
4. **Collision Layers**: Define which objects can interact or collide.
5. **Rules**: Specify how objects interact when moved, focusing on the Player, moving towards Keys, and reaching the Exit.
6. **Win Conditions**: Clearly define when the level is considered complete (all keys collected, reach the exit).
7. **Levels**: Construct one or more levels for the player to navigate with increasing complexity.

Let's implement this framework in the PuzzleScript language:

# Level 2

```

**Explanation:**

- **Objects**: We've defined simple ASCII-like art for each game element: Player, Key, Exit, Wall, and Background.
- **Legend**: Assigns single characters to represent each object within the level layout.
- **Collision Layers**: Specifies what objects can overlap or require a move to interact.
- **Rules**: Define how collecting keys works and that reaching the exit wins the game.
- **Winconditions**: Winning the game require the player on the exit with all keys collected.
- **Levels**: Two sample levels are provided, with increasing complexity and additional walls/keys to navigate.

This setup should provide a complete, functional basic game in PuzzleScript where the player must collect keys and reach the exit to win.
