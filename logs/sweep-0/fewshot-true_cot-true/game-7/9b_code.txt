The error message in the console output is indicating a problem with the rules section of the code. Specifically, it mentions that each pattern on the left-hand side of a rule must have a corresponding pattern on the right-hand side with an equal number of cells. Let's examine the problematic rules:

1. `[> Player | Key] -> [> Player]`
2. `[Player | Exit] -> [Player | Exit] WIN`

In both rules, the left-hand side and the right-hand side have a different number of cells represented. This is causing the error during compilation. The rule syntax requires that if you have a pattern on the left with two cells, it must match with two cells on the right. These rules should be changed to ensure that the number of cells on both sides match.

Here's how you can fix these rules:

1. `[> Player | Key] -> [> Player | Background]` - Here we grab the key and turn the key cell into background (or a blank/empty space).
2. `[Player | Exit] -> [Player | Exit] WIN` can be ignored since it doesn't need explicit modification to match cells on both sides as it is theoretically already correct in its length.

I will adjust the patterns to ensure they have matching numbers of cells, if needed.

Here's the corrected version of the game code:

With this fix, the game should compile without errors, and the game mechanics should work as intended, allowing the player to pick up keys and reach the exit.
