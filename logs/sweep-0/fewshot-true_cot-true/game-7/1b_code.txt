To fix errors in the provided PuzzleScript code, I'll address each issue mentioned in the console output:

1. **Color Palette Error in `Wall`:** The console output indicates that the `Wall` object attempts to access color indices that aren't defined. The defined color string for `Wall` only specifies one color, whereas there should be more to match the references like `.111.`. The proper way to define the colors in a 5x5 matrix is missing here, resulting in the issue.

2. **Missing `SOUNDS` Section:** The `SOUNDS` section should be included right before the `COLLISIONLAYERS` section. Even if it's empty, it still needs to be present as a section header.

3. **Undefined Object Names in Rules:** The rule `[> Player | Key] -> [> Player]` and the win condition refer to `Player` and `Key`, but these likely aren't recognized due to incorrect capitalization or a mismatch between the object name and the legend name.

**Fixes:**
- Define the color pattern for `Wall` correctly along with necessary color codes.
- Add an empty `SOUNDS` section.
- Ensure the case for object names in rules matches the definitions in the `LEGEND` section.

Here's the corrected code:

- **Primary Changes:**
  - Modified the color palette for `Wall` to properly account for all positions in the 5x5 grid as consecutive use of the `1` in the matrix.
  - Added an empty `SOUNDS` section.
  - Updated objects in the `RULES` section to reflect the correct upper-case definitions from `LEGEND`.
  
This should address all the compilation errors.
