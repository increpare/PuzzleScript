To resolve the errors in the given PuzzleScript code, we need to examine the console output messages which indicate errors related to the usage of the "L", "V", "1", and "2" keys not being found. These correspond to the comments `# Level 1` and `# Level 2` within the levels section of the code. In PuzzleScript, comments should use the semicolon `;` instead of the hash `#`, as the hash symbol is used to represent objects in the legend.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to fix the code:
1. Change `# Level 1` and `# Level 2` to `; Level 1` and `; Level 2` respectively, to correctly indicate comments.
2. Verify the rest of the code to ensure it follows the correct syntax and structure for defining objects, collision layers, rules, and win conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```

This code should now compile correctly, and the levels will be annotated properly with comments.
