To repair the code and solve the issues mentioned in the console output, let's take the following steps:

1. **Wall Object Definition:** The error mentions an issue with accessing color indices. The Wall object appears to use three indices, but it's only defined with one color. Update the Wall definition with a correct color palette.

2. **Fixing Key Errors:** The parsing error for "Key" indicates a problem in recognizing color indices or a palette issue. Ensure that the Key object has the correct color definition.

3. **Fix Legend References:** Ensure the legend correctly declares symbols that are used in the level definitions.

4. **Update Rules and Win Conditions:** The win condition currently checks for all exits on players (which would be impossible). This needs to indicate that the player reaches the exit for the game to recognize a win.

Let's correct those sections in the provided code.

### Changes made:

1. **Wall Object Palette:** Assigned a single consistent color for the wall, ensuring no color index errors.
2. **Key Object Palette:** Properly named color indices.
3. **Win Condition:** Changed to reflect that collecting all keys leads to victory.
4. **Legend:** Ensured all used symbols are correctly declared.
5. **Collision Layers and Rules:** Adjusted to correctly interact and aim for intended game logic.
