To fix the errors in the PuzzleScript game code, we need to address the issues related to the level separator (`;`) syntax and ensure that the levels are defined correctly. The reported errors indicate that the parser is trying to interpret the semicolon (`;`) and subsequent level instructions (such as "L", "V", and "1") as game objects or keys which need to be defined. 

The issue arises because the level separator in PuzzleScript is typically a blank line rather than a semicolon (`;`). So, in order to correct this, we'll remove the semicolons and make sure that each level is correctly separated by a new line. This involves ensuring that all levels start and end on separate lines without the semicolon or any other syntax that PuzzleScript doesn't recognize. 

Here is the repaired version of the code:

With these changes:
- Removed the semicolons (`;`) before each level definition, as they are not part of PuzzleScript's syntax for separating levels.
- Added newlines to separate levels, ensuring that the PuzzleScript engine correctly interprets the start and end of each level.
