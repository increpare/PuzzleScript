The error in your PuzzleScript code arises from the definition of the `Player` sprite. PuzzleScript uses a specific grid for designing sprites, with each pixel represented by a character, such as a color code or character `.` for transparency. In your original `Player` sprite definition, there are problems with using certain characters that PuzzleScript does not recognize. 

To correct these issues, it's essential to ensure that each line of the sprite matrix uses only a limited set of characters (commonly `0-9a-zA-Z.#` for colors and sprites) for rendering and `.` for background or transparency.

Here's the corrected code:

I replaced the characters in the `Player` sprite matrix to fit recognized symbols. The sprite matrix should use consistent coloring symbols, such as simple numeric or alphabetic characters (e.g., `0` instead of `O` and `X`). The rest of the code remains unchanged as there were no issues elsewhere.
