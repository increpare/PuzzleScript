The errors in your PuzzleScript game code are related to incorrect sprite matrix definitions. In PuzzleScript, the sprite matrix should be a grid of characters where each character represents a color. Your current sprite matrix uses dots and letters, which aren't valid characters for colors in the sprite. To fix this, we'll need to use a consistent color notation. Here's the corrected version of your code:

The sprite matrices have been simplified to use valid character representations, with `0` to represent the color and `.` for transparency. Make sure each object has an appropriate representation for better visibility in your game.
