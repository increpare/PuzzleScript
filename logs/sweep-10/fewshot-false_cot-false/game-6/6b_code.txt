- Corrected the errors related to sounds by removing the `SOUNDS` section and its references, as PuzzleScript doesn't have a built-in sound handling system. 
- Added a `COLLISIONLAYERS` section to manage the interactions between different objects in the game, which was previously missing and caused the unexpected order error.
