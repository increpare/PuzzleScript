This game is made up of a few objects: Player, Key, Door, Wall, and Background. The player needs to collect all the keys, which will make the door accessible. The rules section outlines how the player moves and interacts with keys and the door. The sound section is defined, assuming specific sound files (sfx9, sfx5, sfx6, sfx7), which can be customized later in the PuzzleScript editor.

The win conditions specify that all keys must be collected for the game to consider the level cleared, and the levels section provides three sample layouts. The game design can be expanded with more levels and additional mechanics for complexity.
