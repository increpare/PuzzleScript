The issue is caused by an incorrect sprite matrix. When defining sprites in PuzzleScript, each character must represent a color from the specific palette, and each matrix row must have the same number of characters. Here's the corrected version of your code:

In the sprite matrix for `Key`, I ensured that each row had a consistent number of symbols and adjusted the pattern to maintain alignment with the expectations of the PuzzleScript engine.
