message Autumn: "I just saw it. The view was marvelous! Thanks for the heads up."

message Winter: "Speaking of our initial introductions, I have a question for you, Spring."

message Spring: "You also slid by so fast, so that's why I assumed I must have seen an animal."

message Summer: "I guess none of us can blame you for making a wrong assumption Spring, 'cause we all did the same."
message Summer: "I still say that my guess was better than all of yours though!"

message Autumn: "I can also hardly remember not knowing about you too, Spring."
message Autumn: "The intermediate time, when I only knew Summer, was a hard time for me, but your optimism and enthusiasm never ceases to inspire me."

message Winter: "Yes, I can imagine that the interim went..."
message Winter: "...well..."

message Autumn: "Quite the way with words as always, Summer."
