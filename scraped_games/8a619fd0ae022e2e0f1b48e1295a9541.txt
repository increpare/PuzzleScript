RULES
======

(Player creates or destroys webs by pressing Action.)
[Action Player no Web] -> [Player Web] Sfx1
[Action Player Web] -> [Player] Sfx2

(Player pushes pushable objects.)
[> Player | Pushable] -> [> Player | > Pushable]

(Gems turn corners counterclockwise. Implemented in a simple gross way because the robust way is horrible)
[> Player | Gem | Blocking] -> [> Player | ^ Gem | Blocking]
[> Player | Gem | Pushable | Blocking] -> [> Player | ^ Gem | Pushable | Blocking]
[> Player | Gem | Pushable | Pushable | Blocking] -> [> Player | ^ Gem | Pushable | Pushable | Blocking]


(Code for propagating movement between webs and pushed objects. The + signs indicate that these rules are "grouped": they'll all keep happening, even out of order, until none of them can happen anymore. That means you can transfer movement from one pebble to another pebble, then from the second pebble to a web, then from that web to some adjacent web, then from THAT web to another pebble, etc.)
[> Sticky Web] -> [> Sticky > Web]
+[> Web Sticky] -> [> Web > Sticky]
+[> Pushable|Pushable] -> [> Pushable|> Pushable]
+[Moving Web|Web] -> [Moving Web|Moving Web]

(If a moving object hits an immovable object, cancel all movement.)
[> Blockable|Blocking] -> Cancel

(At end of turn, should we open doors? Put "Temp" on each door, then remove "Temp" if some switch is uncovered, then delete all switches and doors if Temp still remains.)
late[Door] -> [Temp Door]
late[Switch no Weight][Temp Door] -> [Switch][Door]
late[Temp Door][Switch] -> [Temp Door][]
late[Temp Door] -> [] Sfx3



(At end of turn, kill player if adjacent to ant.)
late[Player|Ant] -> [DeadBug|Ant] Sfx4

(Gem power!)
late[Gem |  | Ant] -> [Gem |  |] sfx5
