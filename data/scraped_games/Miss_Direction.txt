(With the current rule set, there aren't enough objects to give the crate four directional tiles. It would be possible to rewrite the rules so gravity is merged into bodies. However, I think the game works well as is.)

(For the most part, the game mechanics cooperate. However, there are a few annoying feature interactions. For example when a crate is blocked when rounding a corner. I deal with this by ending the level: Indicated by a broken crate and a dead player.

Note that I can free up this tile if I use gravity tiles to provide part of the crates image. Unfortunately, it requires many additional instructions.)

(By giving some of the immobile objects a gravity tile, I can partly exploit collision detection to ensure gravity tiles move consistently with their bodies.)

RULES
======

(Although I'm very happy with the end result, PuzzleScript may not have been the right choice for this game. The interactions between objects in Miss Direction is probably easier to express with code than with rules.)


(Automatic movements)

[ Body MoveUp ] -> [ Up Body ] again
[ Body MoveLeft ] -> [ Left Body ] again
[ Body MoveRight ] -> [ Right Body ] again
[ Body MoveDown ] -> [ Down Body ] again

(Player with no gravity is dead.)

[ Player No Gravity ] -> [ stationary Player ]

(A broken crate ends the level)

[ BrokenCrate ] [ Player Gravity ]  -> [ BrokenCrate ] [ stationary Player ]

(Player can't push towards gravity)

Down [ > PlayerDown GravityDown | Crate ] -> [ PlayerDown GravityDown | Crate ]
Right [ > PlayerRight GravityRight | Crate ] -> [ PlayerRight GravityRight | Crate ]
Left [ > PlayerLeft GravityLeft | Crate ] -> [ PlayerLeft GravityLeft | Crate ]
Up [ > PlayerUp GravityUp | Crate ] -> [ PlayerUP GravityUp | Crate ]

(Player pushes crates)

[ > Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate ] sfx1

(Notes:
* Rules are linear, but the interactions in Miss Direction are aften not. We deal with this by sending movement tiles towards their intended position using "up" (etc) in the rules.
* PuzzleScript properties don't seem to easily let me handle each corner type with a few general rule. I think I could do it with a large table of properties, but that wouldn't be much of an improvement.
)

(INNER CORNERS)

(Top Left Inner Corner)

Left [ > Body GravityUL | InnerCornerTL ] -> [ > Body GravityLeft | InnerCornerTL MoveDown ] again
Up [ > Body GravityUL | InnerCornerTL ] -> [ > Body GravityUp | InnerCornerTL MoveRight ] again

Right Down [ > Body | InnerCornerTL ] -> [ Body | InnerCornerTL ]

(Top Right Inner Corner)

Up [ > Body GravityUR | InnerCornerTR ] -> [ > Body GravityUp | InnerCornerTR MoveLeft ] again
Right [ > Body GravityUR | InnerCornerTR ] -> [ > Body GravityRight | InnerCornerTR MoveDown ] again

Left Down [ > Body | InnerCornerTR ] -> [ Body | InnerCornerTR ]

(Bottom Left Inner Corner)

Down [ > Body GravityDL | InnerCornerBL ] -> [ > Body GravityDown | InnerCornerBL MoveRight ] again
Left [ > Body GravityDL | InnerCornerBL ] -> [ > Body GravityLeft | InnerCornerBL MoveUp ] again

Right Up [ > Body | InnerCornerBL ] -> [ Body | InnerCornerBL ]

(Bottom Right Inner Corner)

Right [ > Body GravityDR | InnerCornerBR ] -> [ > Body GravityRight | InnerCornerBR MoveUp ] again
Down [ > Body GravityDR | InnerCornerBR ] -> [ > Body GravityDown | InnerCornerBR MoveLeft ] again

Up Left [ > Body | InnerCornerBR ] -> [ Body | InnerCornerBR ]

(OUTER CORNERS)

(Top Left Outer Corner)

Down [ Left Body GravityDown | OuterCornerTL ] -> [ Left Body GravityRight Left MoveDown | OuterCornerTL ] again
Right [ Up Body GravityRight | OuterCornerTL ] -> [ Up Body GravityDown Up MoveRight | OuterCornerTL ] again

(Top Right Outer Corner)

Down [ Right Body GravityDown | OuterCornerTR ] -> [ Right Body  GravityLeft Right MoveDown | OuterCornerTR ] again
Left [ Up Body GravityLeft | OuterCornerTR ] -> [ Up Body GravityDown Up MoveLeft | OuterCornerTR ] again

(Bottom Left Outer Corner)

Up [ Left Body GravityUp | OuterCornerBL ] -> [ Left Body GravityRight Left MoveUp | OuterCornerBL ] again
Right [ Down Body GravityRight | OuterCornerBL ] -> [ Down Body GravityUp Down MoveRight | OuterCornerBL ] again

(Bottom Right Outer Corner)

Up [ Right Body GravityUp | OuterCornerBR ] -> [ Right Body GravityLeft Right MoveUp | OuterCornerBR ] again
Left [ Down Body GravityLeft | OuterCornerBR ] -> [ Down Body GravityUp Down MoveLeft | OuterCornerBR ] again

(TIPS)

(The "No Movement" stops a later rule from conflicting with an ealier rule in this section)

(North tip)

Right [ Up Body GravityRight No Movement | NorthTip | ] -> [ Up Body GravityLeft Up MoveRight | NorthTip Up MoveRight | Up MoveDown ] again
Left [ Up Body GravityLeft No Movement | NorthTip | ] -> [ Up Body GravityRight Up MoveLeft | NorthTip Up MoveLeft | Up MoveDown ] again

(South tip)

Right [ Down Body GravityRight No Movement | SouthTip | ] -> [ Down Body GravityLeft Down MoveRight | SouthTip Down MoveRight | Down MoveUp ] again
Left [ Down Body GravityLeft No Movement | SouthTip | ] -> [ Down Body GravityRight Down MoveLeft | SouthTip Down MoveLeft | Down MoveUp ] again

(East tip)

Down [ Right Body GravityDown No Movement | EastTip | ] -> [ Right Body GravityUp Right MoveDown | EastTip Right MoveDown | Right MoveLeft ] again
Up [ Right Body GravityUp No Movement | EastTip | ] -> [ Right Body GravityDown Right MoveUp | EastTip Right MoveUp | Right MoveLeft ] again

(West tip)

Down [ Left Body GravityDown No Movement | WestTip | ] -> [ Left Body GravityUp Left MoveDown | WestTip Left MoveDown | Left MoveRight ] again
Up [ Left Body GravityUp No Movement | WestTip | ] -> [ Left Body GravityDown Left MoveUp | WestTip Left MoveUp | Left MoveRight ] again

(TRAPDOORS AND FLIPS)

(This is a negative rule which prevents bodies going through these elements sideways. It seems more intuitive to prevent it than to allow it.)

Horizontal [ > Body GravityVert | Special ] -> [ Body GravityVert | Special ]
Vertical [ > Body GravityHoriz | Special ] -> [ Body GravityHoriz | Special ]

(FLIP)

Up [ > Body GravityUp | Flip | No Crate ] -> [ > Body GravityDown | Flip MoveUp | ] again

Down [ > Body GravityDown | Flip | No Crate ] -> [ > Body GravityUp | Flip MoveDown | ] again

Left [ > Body GravityLeft | Flip | No Crate ] -> [ > Body GravityRight | Flip MoveLeft | ] again

Right [ > Body GravityRight | Flip | No Crate ] -> [ > Body GravityLeft | Flip MoveRight | ] again

(Force gravity to follow player)

[ > Body Gravity ] -> [ > Body > Gravity ]

(Gravity)

Late Up [ Body GravityUp No Movement | No SupportUp ] -> [ Body GravityUp MoveUp | ] again
Late Down [ Body GravityDown No Movement | No SupportDown ] -> [ Body GravityDown MoveDown | ] again
Late Left [ Body GravityLeft No Movement | No SupportLeft ] -> [ Body GravityLeft MoveLeft | ] again
Late Right [ Body GravityRight No Movement  | No SupportRight ] -> [ Body GravityRight MoveRight | ] again

(Use gravity to select correct tile)

Late [ Player GravityDown ] -> [ PlayerDown GravityDown ]
Late [ Player GravityUp ] -> [ PlayerUp GravityUp ]
Late [ Player GravityLeft ] -> [ PlayerLeft GravityLeft ]
Late [ Player GravityRight ] -> [ PlayerRight GravityRight ]

(Falling off the edge is fatal)

Late [ Body Gravity OuterWall ] -> [ OuterWall] sfx0

(If crates are obstructed during an automatic move, they break and that ends the level. This is not a game-mechanic per se, but is necessary to prevent glitchy behaviour. Known glitches remain, but I think they rarely arise in the current set of levels.)

Late Down [ Crate MoveDown | Crate ] -> [ BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Up [ Crate MoveUp | Crate ] -> [ BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Left [ Crate MoveLeft | Crate ] -> [ BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Right [ Crate MoveRight | Crate ] -> [ BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]

Late Down [ Player MoveDown | Crate | Crate ] -> [ Player | BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Up [ Player MoveUp | Crate | Crate ] -> [ Player | BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Left [ Player MoveLeft | Crate | Crate ] -> [ Player | BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]
Late Right [ Player MoveRight | Crate | Crate ] -> [ Player | BrokenCrate | BrokenCrate ]

This level is designed to draw the player in the wrong direction, but for the right reasons. Namely to give the player lots of opportunity to understand the inner corner logic. The level also introduces semi-circles.

There are two ways to handle a body falling onto an inner corner.
a. you can shift it one tile sideways.
b. You can turn it and let it continue falling sideways.
Both probably lead to viable games. I suspect b. would lead to lots of flying around and make levels difficult to design. Thus, I went for a.

Crates, dorsal fin pattern, jump to exit.

This level was designed to have 1 unit of crate challenge, and also reassure the player that jumping might have a purpose after all. A one-tile drop would give the same effect as the dorsal fin, but the dorsal fine looks nicer.

Crate pushing when player has different gravity to the crate.

Jumping can push a crate. The player has used jump only once so far, so hopefully it's not completely trivial to solve this. The solution is also kind of painful, which I find amusing.

Crates have square corners

This has a red herring, but hopefully the player can discount it quite quickly. Moving a crate along the bottom from the left to the right also hints at the actual solution.

Trap/Flip interactions and reflectors

It's probably not obvious that inner corners do support you. I'm not sure whether I should have exploited that feature. Fortunately, it should be obvious once the wrong solution is attemped.

Nudge from a constructed stack.

Composing existing puzzle elements is a good way to make new levels. I've limited the amount I do it in t his level set, as it tends to make the levels a bit arbitrary.
