message Hey human, A-Alphys here! This is a pre-recorded message, so I can't answer any questions. 
message Y-you need to step into the hole in the floor to progress to the next level. 
message I know that might seem really scary, but it's probably fine.

F..G

message PINK TILES DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND CAN BE WALKED ON WITH NO CONSEQUENCE! RED TILES, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE WALKED ON AT ALL!

.,#,,,#,..
F,#,#,,,.G

message Green tiles would alert a monster to your position, but Papyrus and I are all the way up in the spiral tower working on something else and we didn't get any calls from volunteers, so they, uh... they're pretty much safe to step on.

message YELLOW TILES ARE ELECTRICALLY CHARGED! UNLESS YOU WISH TO BE ELECTROCUTED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE, YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO STEP UPON THEM!

message B-blue tiles, well... They're uh... Water tiles, basically.
message FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH PIRANHAS!
message Piranhas that l-like oranges.
message WHICH ORANGE TILES WILL MAKE YOU RESEMBLE!
message We also made it so that there's a-a fairly large chance that electricity from the Electric block will pass through into the water.

message T-that's all the instructions, right, Papyrus?
message THAT'S RIGHT!
message ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO TELL THEM ABOUT ONE MORE TILE...
message Is it plaid tiles?
message YES, IT'S PLAID TILES.
message I haven't implemented those yet.
message DANG.
message By the way, t-the question-mark blocks are more or less randomized, so you can press R to re-randomize them.
