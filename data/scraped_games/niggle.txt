(while wooden floors are obviously cooler a tiled white floor will be much more identifiable as a kitchen floor, if not a little bit tacky for a futuristic world)

RULES
======

(simulate movement of sun relative to player, the effect is really cool but needs a larger screen zoomed in to really take full effect and needs stars hidden behind the planet and also gravity to start taking effect once you're in the orbit, I'm also gonna say for partial realism the planet should extend much further up and down in a flatter sense to give the impression of great size)
[ > player ] [ stationary sun ] -> [ > player ] [ < sun ]
[ > player ] [ stationary starsone ] -> [ > player ] [ < starsone ]

[ > player | | ... | inneratmosphere ] -> [ |  player | ... | inneratmosphere ]  

late [ starsone activateshrike ] -> [ activateshrike ]
[ starsone | activateshrike ] -> [ | activateshrike ]

late [ sun activateshrike ] -> [ activateshrike ]

(if you were to remove the lates you would get the shrike appearing on the turn subsequent to stepping on the activate shrike thing )

(need to figure out how to get the cup of tea to move with the player once they pick it up)

(WIN CONDITIONS)

(re-entry)
late [ player inneratmosphere ] [inneratmosphere] -> win
(hug on planetsurface)
[hug ] [ planetsurface ] ->  win

late [ player cupoftea ||||||||kitchencabinet] -> win

 [ kitchentable cereal | kitchentable cereal ] -> win

==============
WINCONDITIONS
==============

(some inneratmosphere on player
OR
some hug on planetsurface)
(how to allow for multiple win conditions?)

(needs to be somewhat clear you're returning home after the end of some other great adventure, maybe something about the defeating of the rebels, a little bit ftl like. Rebels is too cliched though.)
message your journey is at a close

message TO DO: re-enter the atmosphere

(going to make a much larger, flatter surface for the planet with a zoomed in map option, also need to hide stars under the atmosphere as well)

(don't want to make it too lame about the "homeness" of the planet)
message back on familiar soil

message TO DO: embrace your loved one

(again it might make sense to have a huge diagonal wingspan to give the impression of size)
(it's really unlikely to walk on the shrike activators, even with a shit ton of them around the place, the best you're going to get is a 1/4 chance on the first turn if you place them adjacent to the player, but must make sure that the tile never chooses the same direction as the player after being stepped on or maybe just two or even three tiles away in some direction after being stepped on)
