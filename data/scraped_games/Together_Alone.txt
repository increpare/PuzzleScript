RULES
======

(Action button switches active players; some helper object trickery is needed 
 to prevent both rules firing at once)
[ Action Ben BenActive ] [ Isabelle ] -> [ Ben ] [ Isabelle IsaWillBeActive ]
[ Action Isabelle IsaActive ] [ Ben ] -> [ Isabelle ] [ Ben BenWillBeActive ]
[ IsaWillBeActive ] -> [ IsaActive ]
[ BenWillBeActive ] -> [ BenActive ]

(Only active player moves; Ben breaks the brown tiles, Isabelle the blue ones
 Note that Ben and Isa can occupy the same tile, and if this is so, the tile cannot
 be broken. In the original game, the tile would crack in this case and break later;
 here we just flip the color to get the same effect)
[ > Ben Isabelle BenActive TileWithBrown | Ground ] -> [ Isabelle BlueTile | Ben BenActive Ground ]
[ > Ben TileWithBrown BenActive | Ground ] -> [ | Ben BenActive Ground ]
[ > Ben BenActive | Ground ] -> [ | Ben BenActive Ground ]
[ > Isabelle Ben IsaActive TileWithBlue | Ground ] -> [ Ben BrownTile | Isabelle IsaActive Ground ]
[ > Isabelle IsaActive TileWithBlue | Ground ] -> [ | Isabelle IsaActive Ground ]
[ > Isabelle IsaActive | Ground ] -> [ | Isabelle IsaActive Ground ]

(Ben can jump over 1-square gaps)
[ > Ben Isabelle BenActive TileWithBrown | No Tile | Ground ] -> [ Isabelle BlueTile | | Ben BenActive Ground ]
[ > Ben BenActive TileWithBrown | No Tile | Ground ] -> [ | | Ben BenActive Ground ]
[ > Ben BenActive | No Tile | Ground ] -> [ | | Ben BenActive Ground ]

(NOTE: Isa could originally step diagonally, but this isn't easy (possible?) to implement 
 in PuzzleScript)

(Stop moving player)
[ > Player ] -> [ Player]
