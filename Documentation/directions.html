<h1>Intermediate Directions and Movement</h1>
<p>
Relative directions rotate along with their pattern
<p>
<pre><code>[ > Player | Crate ] -> [ > Player | > Crate]</code></pre>
<p>
gets compiled to the following set of rules:
<p>
<pre><code>UP [ UP player | crate ] -> [ UP player | UP crate ] 
DOWN [ DOWN player | crate ] -> [ DOWN player | DOWN crate ] 
LEFT [ LEFT player | crate ] -> [ LEFT player | LEFT crate ] 
RIGHT [ RIGHT player | crate ] -> [ RIGHT player | RIGHT crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
You can restrict patterns so that they're only matched in a particular direction (by default, when the interpreter tries to find places to apply to rule, it tries all four rotations of it).  To implement gravity, we could do 
<p>
<pre><code>DOWN [ stationary Object ] -> [ > Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
Which compiles to
<p>
<pre><code>DOWN [ stationary Object ] -> [ DOWN Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
It would probably have been simpler to write the rule as 
<p>
<pre><code>[ stationary Object ] -> [ DOWN Object ]</code></pre>
<p>
which is the same thing.
<p>
Another good illustration of why rule direction might be important would be if you're making a word game.
<p>
<pre><code>[ C | A | T ] -> WIN</code></pre>
<p>
would look for words in all four directions, so TAC would also match this rule. To fix it, you would restrict the rule to read left-to-right as follows:
<p>
<pre><code><a href="../editor.html?demo=wordgame" target="puzzleScript_EditorWindow" class="btn btn-default pull-right" ><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"> Edit</span></a>right [ C | A | T ] -> WIN</code></pre>
<p>

Huzzah!
<hr>

<p>
There are horizontal directons as well - if you want something that moves horizontally when you move horizontally, but ignores you otherwise, you do this
<p>
<pre><code>[ Horizontal  Player ] [ Crate ] -> [  Horizontal  Player ] [  Horizontal Crate  ]</code></pre>
and get this:
<p>
<img src="images/horizontal_follow.gif">
<p>
(Vertical is also a keyword that you can use).
<p>
Vertical and horizontal are both keywords, but is there a way of reducing the following to a single instruction?
<p>
<pre><code>[ ^ Player | Crate ] -> [ ^ Player | ^ Crate ]
[ v Player | Crate ] -> [ v Player | v Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
There is, and it's this:
<p>
<pre><code>[ Perpendicular Player | Crate ] -> [ Perpendicular Player | Perpendicular Crate ]</code></pre>
<p>
Parallel is also a keyword, and means what you think it might :)
<p>
Tip: if you don't know what something does in the examples (or in your own code :S ), add the debug statement to the <a href="prelude.html">prelude</a> and see what it produces.
