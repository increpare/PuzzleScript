These demos aren't necessarily under MIT license.  Ones that are linked to from the dropdown in the editor as examples can be assumed to be so, but other ones are just private records of games that I liked a lot and want to make sure aren’t lost in the sands of time.

If you don’t want your game here, and it’s here, just let me know and I’ll remove it.
