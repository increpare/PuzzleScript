ScriptDoctor
============

To install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To run a local server: `python server.py`. Then, open the local IP address. You should see the PuzzleScript editor page displayed, and some GPT slop appearing in the PuzzleScript terminal and level code editor. 

The main function is run client-side, from inside `ScriptDoctor.js`, which is included in the `editor.html` (which is served by the server). This JS process asks for a game from the server (which makes an OpenAI API call), then throws it in the editor.

Next: compilation, iterative feedback, playtesting. Also fewshot prompting.

Notes:
- We made a single edit to `compile.js` to fix an issue importing gzipper, but we don't actually use the compressed version of the engine at the moment (the one in `bin`---instead just using the one in `src`).

If you're interested in recompiling/modifing/hacking the engine, there is [development setup info here](DEVELOPMENT.md).  If you're just interested in learning how to use the engine/make games in it, [the documentation is here](https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/documentation.html).
