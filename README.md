PuzzleScript With Level Select
==============================

A fork of Stephen Lavelle's Open Source HTML5 Puzzle Game Engine.

If you add `enable_level_select` to your game's prelude, you will get
a level select screen. Slighly more advanced options are available, see
the [documentation](https://pancelor.github.io/PuzzleScript/Documentation/levels.html)
